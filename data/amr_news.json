This study sought to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of <mark>MRSA</mark> at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital (KRRH) in South Western Uganda. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted between June and November 2014 involving 350 pus swabs from infected surgical sites. The samples were cultured on Mannitol salt agar at 37&deg;C for 17- 24 hours and the colonies were tested and confirmed as S. aureus using API staph testing kit. Screening for <mark>MRSA</mark> was performed using the Cefoxitin (30 &micro;g) disc on Muller Hinton agar medium. <mark>MRSA</mark> susceptibility was performed by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion on MHA for the following antibiotics: Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Imipenem, Trimethoprim &ndash; sulfamethoxazole, Levofloxacin and Gentamycin. The zones of inhibition were measured using a ruler and compared with the CLSI guidelines 2012. Results: From the 350 pus swabs, 331 isolates of S. aureus were obtained, of which 179 (54%) isolates were Methicillin resistant. Majority (54%) of the <mark>MRSA</mark> isolates were highly sensitive to Gentamycin and Levofloxacin but highly resistant to Ceftriaxone (100%), Imipenem (100%), Trimethoprim &ndash; sulfamethoxazole (85%), and Erythromycin (67%). Conclusion: The prevalence of <mark>MRSA</mark> in KRRH is high with high resistance to Ceftriaxone, Imipenem, Trimethoprim &ndash; sulfamethoxazole and Erythromycin. However, good sensitivity to gentamycin and Levofloxacin is still observed.</p>\n<p>  Complete list of metadata  </p>",

        "full_content_html": "<p>Many strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been proven to be pathogenic and are sometimes responsible for deadly outbreaks. This bacterium has become more resistant to antibiotics to which it is often sensitive. The aim of this study was to study the evolution of E. coli resistance to antibiotics from 2009 to 2013 at the Yaound&eacute; University Teaching Hospital. We included archived bench files containing information on patient&rsquo;s demographic data and results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The data were analyzed using Microsoft office, Excel 2007 software and SPSS. A total of 350 strains of E. coli were collected from both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using 23 antibiotics from January 2009 to April 2013 at the Bacteriology Unit of the Yaounde University Teaching Hospital. We observed a decrease in the trend of the resistance to 8 of the antibiotics tested: Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacine, colistin, gentamicin and netilmicin. Meanwhile, we noticed an increase in the trend of resistance to 15 antibiotics: Amoxicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefixime, cefepime, aztreonam, amikacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin). The trend observed were statistically significant, for the resistance rate to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (P value=0.002), also to resistance rates of amikacin and cefotaxime (P-values=0.008 and 0.014 respectively). This increase in resistance over the years to most of the commonly used antibiotics has caused E. coli to be classified among multidrug resistant <mark>bacteria</mark>. In order to avoid a therapeutic impasse, it is necessary to carry out sensitization against the abusive use of antibiotics; surveillance activities for multidrug resistant <mark>bacteria</mark> and nosocomial <mark>infection</mark>s should be reinforced as E. coli is one of a most common nosocomial <mark>bacteria</mark>.</p>\n<p>  Complete list of metadata  </p>",

File photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By <strong>Borun Kumar Dash</strong> and <strong>Abdur Rouf</strong></p>\n<p>DHAKA, Jan 14, 2026 (BSS) &ndash; Indiscriminate use of antibiotics without medical advice and the widespread failure to complete prescribed courses are accelerating the rise of <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> <mark><mark>superbugs</mark></mark>, a growing public health threat that experts warn could one day rival&mdash;or even surpass&mdash;cancer in its deadly impact.</p>\n<p>Dr. Hasan Hafizur Rahman, Associate Professor of Medicine at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), made these observations in an interview with BSS.</p>\n<p>Explaining the context and patterns of antibiotic use, Dr. Hafizur Rahman noted that Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent lie within a tropical zone, where infectious diseases and <mark>infection</mark>s are highly prevalent.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Consequently, the use of antibiotics is extensive. However, such use must be rational. Rational use means prescribing antibiotics only to those who genuinely require them. Ensuring this begins with accurate diagnosis,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>He added, &ldquo;Subsequently, blood, urine, or swab cultures from the infected site must be conducted to identify the specific pathogen. Laboratory testing then determines which antibiotic is effective against that germ, and only that proven medication should be administered.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet, selecting the correct drug alone is not sufficient; administering the appropriate dose and ensuring completion of the full prescribed course are indispensable components of effective treatment, said Dr Hafizur Rahman.</p>\n<p>Highlighting the widespread misuse of antibiotics in the country, the physician said that antibiotics are alarmingly easy to obtain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because pharmacies often sell them without prescriptions, many people purchase and consume antibiotics on their own initiative. Even more concerning is the tendency of some individuals to discontinue the medication after one or two doses as soon as they feel slightly better,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>He said those who take antibiotics without consulting a physician rarely complete the full course, which is extremely harmful to the human body.</p>\n<p>In addition, pharmacy attendants, village doctors, and unregistered practitioners in various areas frequently prescribe antibiotics, he said adding as a result of such indiscriminate use, antibiotics are steadily losing their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Warning about the side effects and risks of antibiotics, Dr Hafizur Rahman said excessive use is causing a wide range of long-term harm to the human body.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many antibiotics have significant adverse effects. Special caution is required when selecting antibiotics for patients with chronic liver disease, kidney disease, or heart conditions&mdash;known in medical science as comorbid conditions,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In cases involving diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, or kidney failure, dosage adjustments are essential as some antibiotics can be toxic to the kidneys or liver, referred to as nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic drugs, he said.</p>\n<p>Therefore, physicians must carefully consider whether a patient has other underlying conditions and assess liver and kidney function before selecting the medication with the least potential for side effects, he said.</p>\n<p>Dr Hafizur Rahman said incorrect drug selection or excessive dosing can cause severe and irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver.</p>\n<p>He further explained that improper use of antibiotics leads to the development of <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> within the body.</p>\n<p>This will eventually give rise to <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> organisms, or <mark><mark>superbugs</mark></mark>. Such <mark>pathogens</mark> will pose a grave challenge and threat to medical science.</p>\n<p>In the future, these <mark><mark>superbugs</mark></mark> may become even more terrifying than cancer. At that stage, no antibiotic may work even for minor illnesses, and effective treatment options might simply cease to exist. This is not merely an individual problem but a dire warning signal for the entire nation and the global community.</p>\n<p>Dr. Hafizur Rahman emphasized that addressing this crisis requires the strict enforcement of existing drug administration laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The sale of antibiotics without a prescription from a registered physician must be completely prohibited. Pharmacy owners and dispensers must also be made fully aware of their responsibilities so that antibiotics are never sold without a valid prescription,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>At the same time, physicians must review culture and sensitivity reports before prescribing antibiotics, he said.</p>\n<p>The unnecessary use of multiple antibiotics simultaneously should be avoided, and drug selection must be made cautiously, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s other medical conditions, said Dr Hafizur Rahman.</p>\n<p>He added that the media must play a proactive role in curbing the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The prevailing tendency of purchasing and consuming antibiotics must be stopped, he said.</p>\n<p>The physician said only by raising awareness at every level&mdash;among patients, drug sellers, and physicians alike&mdash;can <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> and drug inefficacy be prevented.</p>\n<p>He said this collective effort will also help safeguard future generations from the catastrophic threat posed by <mark><mark>superbugs</mark></mark>.</p>",

At periodic intervals, diseases caused by <mark>pathogens</mark>, because of something that went wrong in the system, grow much larger than they are meant to. They take the form of outbreaks, epidemics, even pandemics, if we don&rsquo;t get there on time. These past weeks, the new year cheer was dulled with news of the Indore diarrhoea epidemic, where severe water contamination was identified to be source of the outbreak, and this week, it is Nipah, with a fresh rash of cases in West Bengal.</p>\n<p>At West Bengal, though, it is just beginning to emerge into public consciousness. <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/west-bengal/centre-steps-in-as-two-nipah-cases-detected-in-bengal/article70502064.ece\">Two healthcare workers suspected of being infected by the Nipah virus in Barasat city</a> in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal are undergoing treatment, officials said on January 12, 2026. The cases were detected at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Kalyani in West Bengal&rsquo;s Nadia district on the night of January 11 night, reports <b>Shrabana Chatterjee</b>. &ldquo;Patients are under treatment and observation. Contact-tracing and treatment plans have already been made,&rdquo; West Bengal Chief Secretary Nandini Chakraborty said. Both patients are employed at the hospital they are being treated in. Officials have not yet disclosed the name of the facility.</p>\n<p>State government officials said the two patients had travelled to Purba Bardhaman on personal work. Contact-tracing is therefore being done across North 24 Parganas, Purba Bardhaman, and Nadia districts. Officials also said the patients had not travelled outside West Bengal in the recent past and that authorities are in touch with their families. Meanwhile, the Union Health Ministry said a national joint outbreak response team has been deployed to support the State government in containment and public health response measures. Given the serious nature of Nipah virus <mark>infection</mark>, which is a zoonotic disease with high mortality and potential for rapid spread, the situation is being handled with utmost priority, a senior Health Ministry official said.</p>\n<p>In Indore, contaminated drinking water, supplied through government-laid pipelines, led to a diarrhoea outbreak killing at least 8 and affecting about 3,000 people. <b>Mehul Malpani</b> reports that these areas were the unplanned parts of one of Madhya Pradesh&rsquo;s most promising cities, where the effects of delays in laying pipelines, were disastrous.

Climate change is indeed influencing viral mutations, she said citing the H1N1 influenza virus, whose cases have increasingly jumped from birds to mammals, with occasional human <mark>infection</mark>s. The number of such spillover events is rising in the United States, and as the virus continues to mutate, the likelihood of human <mark>infection</mark>s &mdash; and potential pandemics &mdash; increases, she added.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile an old, old disease has seen a resurgence too. The Hindu&rsquo;s Kerala bureau reported that <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/leprosy-cases-on-the-rise-in-kasaragod-with-32-people-under-treatment/article70478164.ece\">Leprosy cases are on the rise in Kasaragod with 32 people under treatment</a>. Kerala has an exemplary surveillance system, and is among the first steps to notice and report trends in infectious diseases.

Privatisation further compounds the chronic underfunding that has hit the public health care system. With private equity increasingly driving India&rsquo;s private healthcare industry, doctors are now expected to meet monthly targets, much like in any profit-driven sector. Through schemes such as AB PMJAY and rampant public-private partnerships, public money is increasingly shunted to the private sector, further weakening the public health system, he says.</p>\n<p><b>Bindu Shajan Perappadan </b>reported that the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/central-drug-regulator-releases-guidelines-on-compounding-of-offences/article70482373.ece\">Central drug regulator released guidelines to compound minor drug violations</a>.

For offences based on record keeping and disclosure, compounding prevents needless criminalisation and lets enforcement focus on direr violations. However, the main pitfalls are the guidelines regressing into a &lsquo;pay and pass&rsquo; scheme and the CDSCO&rsquo;s transparency.</p>\n<p>On to the subject of non-communicable diseases, and what the world has been obsessing over: the wonder weight loss drugs. Less than two years after stopping obesity drugs, weight and health issues return, a recent <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/less-than-two-years-after-stopping-obesity-drugs-weight-and-health-issues-return-study-finds/article70490373.ece\">study</a> found.</p>\n<p>Reviewing data &zwnj;on 9,341 obese or overweight patients treated ​in 37 studies with any of 18 different weight-loss medications, researchers found they regained on average nearly one pound (0.4 kg) per month after stopping the drugs, and were projected to return to pre-treatment weight by 1.7 years. Heart health risk factors, such ​as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, that benefited ⁠from the drugs were projected to return to pre-treatment levels within 1.4 years after stopping the medications, on average, according to a ​report of the study ⁠published in The <i>BMJ.</i></p>\n<p>Staying on the subject of obesity, a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/waist-to-height-ratio-better-than-bmi-at-detecting-obesity-risk-in-older-adults-study/article70498649.ece\">new study</a> found that the waist-to-height ratio is better than BMI at detecting obesity risk in older adults.

        "full_content_html": "<p>Poultry Weight Gain Medicine Enhancing Growth Performance in Poultry Farming</p>\n<p>Poultry farming plays a critical role in meeting the world&rsquo;s increasing demand for chicken meat and eggs. As a highly efficient source of protein, poultry requires optimal growth conditions to ensure maximum yield. One crucial aspect of this efficiency is weight gain, a key indicator of the health and productivity of the flock. In this context, poultry weight gain medicine has emerged as an important tool for farmers aiming to enhance growth performance and profitability.</p>\n<p>The Importance of Weight Gain in Poultry Farming</p>\n<p>Weight gain in poultry is not just about the quantity of meat produced; it also reflects the overall health of the birds. Healthy weight gain means that chickens are receiving the right balance of nutrients, and it often correlates with increased egg production in layers. By monitoring and optimizing weight gain, farmers can better manage flock health, reduce feed costs, and increase returns on their investment.</p>\n<p>Types of Poultry Weight Gain Medicines</p>\n<p>Poultry weight gain medicines can be categorized into several types, including growth promoters, antibiotics, and probiotics. Each of these plays a unique role in promoting growth and improving the health of the birds.</p>\n<p>1. Growth Promoters These are substances added to poultry feed to stimulate growth. Commonly used growth promoters include hormones and synthetic compounds that can enhance feed efficiency. However, due to growing concerns over the safety and ethical implications of chemical use in livestock, many countries have started to regulate or ban certain growth promoters. This has led to an increased interest in more natural alternatives.</p>\n<p>2. Antibiotics These are often prescribed to prevent and treat <mark>infection</mark>s in poultry. By ensuring that birds remain disease-free, antibiotics can indirectly contribute to weight gain by allowing the poultry to utilize feed more efficiently. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics is being scrutinized due to the risk of <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, prompting a shift towards more judicious use and exploring alternatives.</p>\n<p>3. Probiotics and Prebiotics Another growing trend in poultry farming is the use of probiotics and prebiotics to promote gut health. A healthy gut microbiome improves nutrient absorption, enhances immune response, and leads to better overall growth rates. This natural approach is gaining popularity as consumers lean towards antibiotic-free poultry products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.skyvetpharm.com/products\"><strong>poultry weight gain medicine</strong></a></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Effective Medications for Promoting Poultry Weight Gain and Growth Improvement\" src=\"https://www.skyvetpharm.com/images/7_17241467282841.webp\"></img></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.skyvetpharm.com/products\"><strong><p>Nutritional Strategies for Weight Gain</p><br>\n</strong></a></p>\n<p>Aside from the medicinal approaches, proper nutrition is fundamental to achieving optimal weight gain in poultry. Farmers must ensure that their flock has access to a balanced diet that includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals.</p>\n<p>1. High-Quality Feed The formulation of poultry feed can greatly impact growth rates. A high-quality feed that meets the specific needs of the poultry at different growth stages is essential. For instance, starter feeds for chicks are typically higher in protein to support rapid growth, while layers require a different nutrient profile for egg production.</p>\n<p>2. Feed Additives The inclusion of certain additives, such as amino acids, enzyme supplements, and vitamins, can enhance feed efficiency and promote growth. These additives can help in breaking down feed components, making nutrients more accessible to the birds.</p>\n<p>3. Water and Feed Accessibility Ensuring that poultry have constant access to clean water and feed is crucial. Restricting access can lead to stress and inadequate weight gain.</p>\n<p>Conclusion The Future of Poultry Weight Gain Medicine</p>\n<p>In conclusion, poultry weight gain medicine encompasses a wide range of strategies aimed at maximizing growth and health in birds. As the industry evolves, there is a clear trend towards more sustainable and responsible farming practices. The future of poultry weight gain will likely see a continued shift towards natural growth enhancers, careful antibiotic use, and an emphasis on improving overall flock health through nutrition.</p>\n<p>Farmers who harness the benefits of modern research while adhering to ethical and safety standards will be best positioned to meet the rising global demand for poultry products. The pursuit of efficiency in poultry farming not only supports business growth but also addresses broader dietary needs across the globe, making the role of poultry weight gain medicine more significant than ever.</p>",

Here&rsquo;s what they told us.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>Obesity guidelines. Check. Anti-obesity drugs. Check. What now?</em> </strong></h2>\n<p>About <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1614362\">one-third of all South Africans</a> are now living with obesity, a condition associated with <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=a%20Healthy%20Weight?-,Health%20Risks,Mental%20health%20problems\">dozens of noncommunicable diseases</a> (NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease and some types of cancer. In November last year, South Africa released its first <a href=\"https://samajournals.co.za/index.php/samj/issue/view/149\">clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of adult obesity</a>. It defines obesity as a chronic disease, and helps doctors decide how to treat it, from health support without weight-shaming to medicines and surgery.</p>\n<p>It also includes recommendations for <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2025-who-issues-global-guideline-on-the-use-of-glp-1-medicines-in-treating-obesity\">GLP-1s</a> (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists), better known under brand names like Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2025-who-issues-global-guideline-on-the-use-of-glp-1-medicines-in-treating-obesity\">medication</a> helps lower blood sugar levels, slows digestion and increases the feeling of fullness. These are approved for diabetes in South Africa, while Wegovy was approved for <a href=\"https://pi-pil-repository.sahpra.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Final-Wegovy-PIL.pdf\">weight management</a> last year.</p>\n<p>Experts say the drugs, which have been <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2005/021773_Byetta_approv.PDF\">used to treat diabetes for 20 years</a>, are a gamechanger in fighting obesity. But monthly prices that range from about R3 000 to R6 000, according to experts we spoke with, put the drugs out of reach for almost everyone. They are not yet available in the public sector, and because weight loss is not included under the <a href=\"https://www.medicalschemes.co.za/resources/pmb/\">conditions medical aids</a> are legally required to cover, they have to be paid for out of pocket.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304\">Research released in early January,</a> which reviewed 37 studies, also showed that, in clinical trials, people who used weight-loss drugs for an average of around 10 months, and then stopped using them, picked up all the kilograms they lost &mdash; and fast. So, like other chronic medications, the drugs ideally need to be used lifelong.</p>\n<p>We talked with an endocrinologist who helped craft the obesity guidelines and a researcher working at the crossroads of HIV treatment and obesity management about what&rsquo;s ahead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sunwardparkmedical.co.za/index.php/portfolio-items/angela/\"><strong>Angela Murphy</strong></a><strong>, endocrinologist</strong></p>\n<p>The guidelines will help educate the healthcare sector, like providers, doctors, nursing staff, government and policymakers, about how they approach people living with obesity.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons people are obese. But it&rsquo;s important to understand that <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199005243222102\">up to 70%</a> of the reason a person lives with obesity is genetic. It&rsquo;s not an issue of willpower. It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199503093321001\">biological response to weight loss</a> because the body wants to defend the weight it sees as the normal weight. We also have to have healthy, balanced diets, and we have to have exercise. But the statistics tell us that a healthy lifestyle alone, on average, can possibly get up to <a href=\"https://www.cdrnet.org/vault/2459/web/files/Franz.pdf\">5% weight loss</a>. This is where medications become incredibly valuable.</p>\n<p>Obesity is complicated, and it&rsquo;s not easy to treat because it involves our genetics, our environment and how we eat. But obesity is a disease, and we need to treat it as such.</p>\n<p>For the GLP-1s, we need political will, as we did with HIV and antiretrovirals, where our ministers came on board. You need drug makers, so Eli Lilly [manufacturers of Mounjaro] and Novo Nordisk [manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy], to come to the party around pricing.</p>\n<p>Often, we think we need $100-million [about R16.5-million] to do anything, but awareness campaigns work. We did that a lot in the early days of HIV, and we need to do that when it comes to obesity, which means you would also be educating people about type 2 diabetes and noncommunicable diseases.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>The NHI will be stuck in court. And might just die there</em></strong></h2>\n<p>After nearly two decades of promises, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202405/50664nathealthinsuranceact202023.pdf\">National Health Insurance Act</a> was signed into law in May of 2024. The state-run fund promises to do away with the current form of private medical schemes &mdash; which <a href=\"https://www.medicalschemes.co.za/wp-content/CMSIndustryReport2024_4Dec.pdf\">about 15% of South Africans have</a> &mdash; and better serve the remaining 85% who depend on public health services.</p>\n<p>But almost as soon as President Ramaphosa signed it, lawsuits started piling up. <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-beat-shorts/2025-11-10-is-the-nhi-channelling-operation-dudulas-healthcare-blockades/\">Our latest count</a>: <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BHF-consolidated-Public-Participation-application-CC-signed-compressed.pdf\">nine separate court actions</a>.</p>\n<p>The charges are myriad: procedural flaws in the parliamentary process; inadequate public input; an <a href=\"https://hfassociation.co.za/nhi_documents/Genesis%20Analytics%20Report.pdf\">unrealistic tax-based</a> financial structure; disputes about plans for <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-beat-shorts/2025-11-10-is-the-nhi-channelling-operation-dudulas-healthcare-blockades/\">medical aid schemes</a>; consolidation of control under the health minister; consistent failures in service delivery; and the <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-beat-shorts/2025-11-10-is-the-nhi-channelling-operation-dudulas-healthcare-blockades/\">blocking of access</a> to treatment for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.</p>\n<p>Sitting now with the Constitutional Court is Ramaphosa&rsquo;s appeal to a previous ruling that required he provide, essentially, a show of his due diligence before signing. An end-of-year application from the health minister asked to consolidate five of the pending cases and put them on hold until the Court&rsquo;s decision on Ramaphosa&rsquo;s appeal.</p>\n<p>Similar concerns are raised in a South African case study in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(26)00027-9/fulltext\">Global Health Watch</a>, a <em>Lancet</em>-published analysis of global health reform released on 10 January.</p>\n<p>The experts we spoke with say NHI progress will be stalled &mdash; mired in court throughout 2026. That is, they say, if it survives at all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://health.uct.ac.za/school-public-health/contacts/susan-cleary-0\"><strong>Susan Cle</strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://health.uct.ac.za/school-public-health/contacts/susan-cleary-0\">a</a></strong><a href=\"https://health.uct.ac.za/school-public-health/contacts/susan-cleary-0\"><strong>ry</strong></a><strong>, health economist, University of Cape Town </strong></p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s been so sad about the NHI debate is that we are saying that an NHI is better than a National Health Service (NHS) system, which is what we&rsquo;ve got at the moment. But there are no strong grounds to suggest that NHI is better; these are simply different ways of financing a health system. In fact, the NHS is an outstanding funding model.</p>\n<p>Also, there are huge costs of change associated with that switch, and the Act itself has serious flaws. It&rsquo;s written in a way that gives legal force to regulations added later &mdash; regulations that give a lot of power to the minister. He can appoint almost everyone and this means there&rsquo;s hardly any corruption safeguard.</p>\n<p>There were many years of engagements on this, and problems were pointed out. They sat on that for years, and then it was signed with no changes, despite all the inputs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsg.ac.za/people/adjunct-professor-alex-van-den-heever\"><strong>Alex van den Heever</strong></a><strong>, economist and chair of social security systems administration and management studies, University of the Witwatersrand</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s technically not lawful because the objectives of the legislation itself cannot be achieved, meaning it promises outcomes that the system it creates is not capable of delivering<em>. </em>For example, it relies on shifting medical scheme contributions into the tax system at a time <a href=\"https://www.samajournals.co.za/index.php/samj/article/view/3084/1589\">when government has no realistic capacity to raise additional tax.</a></p>\n<p>Government has never done the heavy lifting required to make a proper proposal on health reform. They&rsquo;ve generated no systematic analysis of the private sector, of the public sector, nothing to justify the institutional restructuring they&rsquo;ve proposed; nothing on governance.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>AI: Full speed ahead</em></strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266725000362\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is already reshaping public health</a> &mdash; diagnosing illnesses, analysing complex datasets and uncovering patterns in research in ways that humans might not even consider.</p>\n<p>A study in <em>Nature Genetics </em>found <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01898-1\">AI was able</a> to predict which people would later be diagnosed with diseases, sometimes years before doctors identified them. AI-assisted screening for TB &mdash; which has been <a href=\"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/x1dh0ls4/publication_south-africa-digital-health_casestudy_en.pdf\">tested in South Africa</a> &mdash; can read and interpret chest x-rays at a speed and scale humans could never do, with the potential to quickly identify TB hotspots, a cornerstone of prevention.</p>\n<p>The experts we spoke with were enthusiastic and cautious, warning about risks of hype and misuse. For now, they say, it remains dependent on human expertise and data quality &mdash; and they say to researchers and healthcare providers not using it: you better start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2308/thomas-hartung\"><strong>Thomas Hartung</strong></a><strong>, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health professor and editor of </strong><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence\"><strong><em>Frontiers in AI</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>Since the early 2010s, the computing power used to <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/ai-and-compute/\">train leading AI systems</a> has been doubling roughly every three months, a pace that can make this year&rsquo;s AI several times more powerful than last year. Nobody can read the millions of scientific papers that are produced each year, but AI can and does not forget.</p>\n<p>Traditional drug development <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trci.2017.10.005\">typically takes 12 years</a> and costs roughly <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.01.012\">$3-billion per drug</a>. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037851732500626X\">AI-first drugs</a> [developed and designed by AI] reached human trials in 2023 after only four years of pre-clinical development. Major companies are now increasingly using AI to speed up every single step of the [development process]; each day saved in getting a drug to market is worth at least $1-million to the developer.</p>\n<p>AI is making it possible to map how what we&rsquo;re exposed to around us &mdash; like air pollution, chemicals, diet and stress &mdash; affect our health. By combining data from large population studies and routine blood and urine tests, researchers can track how these exposures affect the body over time. This is laying the groundwork for &ldquo;digital twins&rdquo; &mdash; digital stand-ins for real people that help explain how things in our surroundings can make us sick.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ezintsha.org/leadership/siphamandla-gumede/\"><strong>Siphamandla Gumede</strong></a><strong>, researcher, Ezintsha, Wits University</strong></p>\n<p>We are already seeing people using AI as a screening tool. If you&rsquo;ve got a headache, you search, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a forehead headache&rdquo;. It will probably tell you have a certain type of headache, that you need to seek care or you need to get a certain type of treatment.</p>\n<p>The high-impact goal for 2026 would be to use AI to set off a fully networked public health system that will be able to link [the health profile] of someone, no matter where they are in the country. So if you went to a clinic and picked up pills, it should be seen up on the system. If you&rsquo;ve missed your clinic visit, there will be [a text, call or email] telling you that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/geertsguido/?originalSubdomain=nl\"><strong>Guido Geerts</strong></a><strong>, CEO Delft Imaging Systems </strong></p>\n<p>With an x-ray of your chest, a doctor can see if you have TB. The AI can do it better, and faster, than a radiologist. Our current AI system has read about <a href=\"https://delft.care/lung-health/\">30-million cases worldwide </a>and has become very intelligent in recognising TB. But AI can make a mistake, like a human. What is still the case is that some other lung abnormalities may not be well visible.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>The tobacco Bill is coming. Just not likely in its current form</em></strong></h2>\n<p>Work on tobacco legislation <a href=\"https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201805/41617gon475re.pdf\">began in 2018</a>. But it took until August 2025 for the Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Control Systems <a href=\"https://static.pmg.org.za/B33-2022__Tobacco_Products_and_Electronic_Delivery_Systems.pdf\">Bill</a> to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.gov.za/press-releases/media-statement-health-committee-concludes-public-hearings-tobacco-bill\">wrap up public hearings</a>. Parliament&rsquo;s health committee will now decide whether to move ahead.</p>\n<p>The legislation bans tobacco product displays at points of sale, single cigarette sales and smoking in public areas &mdash; and mostly applies the same rules to e-cigarettes and vapes, which are currently unregulated. But the industry is pushing back hardest on requirements for <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-news-south-africa/2025-07-08-if-your-cigarette-box-isnt-disgusting-its-not-doing-its-job/\">plain packaging and graphic warnings</a> (saying it would encourage illicit trade) and the Bill&rsquo;s ban on advertising of <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-news-south-africa/2025-06-26-vapes-are-safe-alternatives-to-smoking-and-other-lies-they-told-us/\">electronic devices</a>. The industry uses the term &ldquo;<a href=\"https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/30/e1/e1\">harm reduction</a>&rdquo; to argue that the devices are &ldquo;safer&rdquo; than traditional cigarettes. But public health experts <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/health-news-south-africa/2025-06-26-vapes-are-safe-alternatives-to-smoking-and-other-lies-they-told-us/\">refute that claim</a> and are worried about vape marketing to children, with <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024005492?via%3Dihub\">use among high schoolers</a> found to be around 17%.</p>\n<p>The experts we spoke with are confident that a Bill will go through in 2026. But how it ends up is another story.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.up.ac.za/school-of-health-systems-and-public-health/organisational-structure\"><strong>Lekan Ayo-Yusuf</strong></a><strong>, head of University of Pretoria&rsquo;s school of public health and director of the Africa Centre for Tobacco</strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been <a href=\"https://www.atim.co.za/download/sasas-south-africa-%E2%80%90atim-2024tobacco-nicotine-use-survey/#\">documenting e-cigarette use since 2010</a>, and the trend is very clear: there is a parallel increase in e-cigarette use and in smoking.</p>\n<p>The industry is pushing back on the e-cigarette marketing ban because they say they need to [advertise] harm reduction to consumers. This is <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9994580/\">despite studies</a> showing that this <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11734163/\">didn&rsquo;t matter to users</a>, especially nicotine-naive youth [people who haven&rsquo;t used nicotine before] who are <a href=\"https://bhekisisa.org/opinion/2025-11-13-hey-parliament-our-kids-are-getting-addicted-to-vapes-lets-put-an-end-to-it/\">increasingly taking up these products</a> for their attractive designs and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5536860/\">flavours</a>.</p>\n<p>The tobacco industry wants to see a Bill. But it just wants the committee to remove and rewrite. So it may be that the committee creates its own watered-down Bill and goes with that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commerce.uct.ac.za/reep/contacts/corne-van-walbeek\"><strong>Corn&eacute; van Walbeek</strong></a><strong>, University of Cape Town economics professor and director of the Research Unit on the Economics of Excisable Products<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Often, people think about illicit trade as [counterfeiting or] smuggling across borders. But the main source of illicit trade is easy to fix.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve got multinationals talking about illicit trade: British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, JTI. They are at public hearings, and are very noisy, and come across as &ldquo;we are your friends. We are here to support you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t hear from the local companies &mdash; Amalgamated Tobacco, Carnilinx and Polaris (Gold Leaf Tobacco). But they are registered with the South African Revenue Service, Sars. They are, in principle, legitimate companies. But <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10941134/\">we&rsquo;ve found</a> they produce, say, a million cigarettes, and might declare 100 000. Our best estimate is that 60% of cigarette taxes have not been fully paid. Local groups work on the principle of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make as much money as we can, as quickly as we can&rdquo; because at some point the government&rsquo;s going to crack down. Sars could greatly reduce illicit cigarettes with supply control measures, like <a href=\"https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/track-and-trace/\">track and trace technology</a> systems that monitor cigarettes from factory to shop.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>TB rates declined. Now we have to keep them dropping</em></strong></h2>\n<p>Over the past decade, South Africa has <a href=\"https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/tb_profiles/?_inputs_&tab=%22charts%22&lan=%22EN%22&iso3=%22ZAF%22&entity_type=%22country%22\">reduced the number of people getting TB by about 60%</a>, driven by better testing and treatment; for every 10 people who used to get TB, only about four do today. Yet we still have one of the highest TB rates in the world. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772707625000207#bbib0004\">Studies</a> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21333099/\">suggest </a>that more than 50% of South Africans carry the <mark>infection</mark> without being sick, while about <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4144869/\">one in 10</a> of those will go on to develop an active disease, usually when something weakens their immune system.</p>\n<p>Alongside poverty, poor nutrition and crowded living conditions, the <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TB-Recovery-Plan-4_final_250526-1.pdf\">high number of South Africans living with HIV</a>, which leaves them more susceptible to TB, drives our numbers up. Experts are now concerned about the rise in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12067902/\">resistance to bedaquiline</a>, the drug that has been used to <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2012/204384orig1s000ltr.pdf\">treat <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> TB since 2012</a>. Also worrying: <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11984525/\">the 15-20% sliced out of our TB programme</a> and uncertainty around research due to funding cuts that could quickly reverse our gains.</p>\n<p>But breakthroughs are converging: portable digital x-rays, <a href=\"https://www.theglobalfund.org/media/x1dh0ls4/publication_south-africa-digital-health_casestudy_en.pdf\">AI-assisted diagnostics</a> and since 2022, targeted testing of high-risk groups, like those with HIV, regardless of symptoms. And some research in the pipeline looks promising.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ahri.org/scientist/limakatso-lebina/\"><strong>Limakatso Lebina</strong></a><strong>, director of clinical trials at Africa Health Research Institute </strong></p>\n<p>If you have TB symptoms, you are easy to find: you are sick, you go to the clinic or hospital and you will be tested. The problem is that South Africa&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/system/files/elibdownloads/2023-04/A4_SA_TPS%2520Short%2520Report_10June20_Final_highres.pdf\">first national TB prevalence survey</a>, done in 2018, showed that more than half of people found to have TB were asymptomatic, so not complaining of any <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis\">symptoms</a> [such as a prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss].</p>\n<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is if asymptomatic people can transmit the virus. It&rsquo;s become clear that TB is a spectrum of illness. Maybe everyone starts as asymptomatic, and with time can become more symptomatic. Is that what is hindering progress in the fight against TB? Is it because people don&rsquo;t know they have TB, then interact with family and community members and transmit TB unknowingly? <a href=\"https://www.ahri.org/could-symptom-free-people-be-unknowingly-passing-tb-to-others-major-study-launches-in-south-africa-and-indonesia/\">That&rsquo;s what we hope to find with our research</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://idm.uct.ac.za/contacts/mark-hatherill\"><strong>Mark Hatherill</strong></a><strong>, director of the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, University of Cape Town</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310750/#:~:text=8BCG%20vaccination,tuberculosis%20is%20therefore%20limited.\">BCG vaccine</a> given to children gives 70-80% protection against TB in children under five. But that protection wears off after about 10 years, which means people can get TB later, as adolescents and adults, who can then infect others. This drives the cycle of the epidemic. To switch it off, we need a vaccine that doesn&rsquo;t need to be given multiple times.</p>\n<p>Right now, there are two leading candidates: <a href=\"https://www.protocols.io/view/protocol-title-a-phase-3-randomized-double-blind-p-kxygxwjzdv8j/v1\">M72/AS01E</a>, which is showing 50% protection against the virus, and a vaccine called <a href=\"https://www.iavi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iavi_fact_sheet_MTBVAC.pdf\">MTBVAC</a>. Both will probably report in 2028-2029. South Africa has a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; TB epidemic, meaning the disease is still spreading actively in communities. Even a TB vaccine that is 30% effective could matter a great deal &mdash; far better than no vaccine at all.</p>\n<h2><strong><em>HIV: Breakthrough science, strained delivery</em></strong></h2>\n<p>The public health community is excited about the roll-out of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240111608\">lenacapavir</a> (LEN), the groundbreaking six-monthly HIV prevention jab, and <a href=\"https://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2025/148.html\">recent legal changes</a> for trained pharmacists to prescribe antiretrovirals.

India is among seven countries participating in the project, said the officials.</p>\n<p>Carbapenem antibiotics are considered last-resort drugs for treating severe <mark>bacteria</mark>l <mark>infection</mark>s. Rising resistance to these antibiotics poses a serious challenge, as treatment options become extremely limited, expensive and often ineffective. The study focuses on understanding how widespread carbapenem resistance is and why it is emerging.</p>\n<p>To better understand how resistance develops and spreads, the study has now started conducting whole-genome sequencing at these sites, including BJMC-Sassoon General Hospital. Genome sequencing allows scientists to identify the specific genetic changes that make <mark>bacteria</mark> resistant to carbapenem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Once organisms become resistant to carbapenem, treatment becomes extremely difficult, as the remaining antibiotics are very limited and often expensive. It is crucial to understand whether this resistance is spreading and how,&rdquo; said Dr Bharat Randive, chief study coordinator for Johns Hopkins University and Indian sites.</p>\n<p>The whole-genome sequencing will help identify new or unusual resistance mechanisms and help the researchers better understand known mechanisms. Through genome sequencing, researchers will determine whether <mark>infection</mark>s in different patients are caused by the same strain or by different sources, and identify common, rare or new resistance genes circulating in Indian hospitals.</p>\n<p>Dr Randive added: &ldquo;The study is important to help develop future antibiotics and also guide the current therapy for patients.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to health officials, the objective of the project is to strengthen surveillance at selected hospitals and assess the prevalence and patterns of carbapenem resistance. Under the programme, researchers are analysing clinical samples from admitted patients to identify the type of organism causing <mark>infection</mark> and determine whether it is resistant to carbapenem.</p>\n<p>Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, principal investigator for BJMC-SGH, said, &ldquo;Genome sequencing helps us understand which genes are responsible for resistance, whether the <mark>infection</mark>s in different patients are linked, and whether they are coming from the same source or multiple sources.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He further said that with very few effective antibiotics left for carbapenem-resistant <mark>infection</mark>s, understanding how resistance is developing and spreading is critical. &ldquo;This study will provide scientific evidence that can help protect patients and strengthen hospital <mark>infection</mark> control,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>As part of the surveillance that began in 2023 at these three sites, the prevalence of carbapenem resistance was initially assessed in clinical samples (patients admitted in ICU). Through testing clinical samples of admitted patients, the organisms causing <mark>infection</mark>s and whether they are resistant to carbapenem were found. Samples of over 6,000 admitted patients from three hospitals have been collected and are under analysis, the officials said.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the second component of the study focuses on colonisation surveillance in intensive care units (ICUs). Colonisation refers to the presence of <mark>bacteria</mark> in the body without causing disease, but which can spread to other patients, particularly in hospital settings. Researchers have studied colonisation in more than 2,000 ICU patients (at three sites) by testing rectal swab samples to assess how many patients are carrying carbapenem-resistant organisms. Such <mark>bacteria</mark> can spread rapidly due to inadequate hygiene or sanitation and later cause serious <mark>infection</mark>s, they warned.</p>",

The origin of life remains one of the most profound unsolved issues, encompassing how non-living chemical compounds transitioned to self-replicating, evolving systems under <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Early_Earth\">early Earth</a> conditions, including the roles of hydrothermal vents, RNA-world hypotheses, and prebiotic synthesis.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[1]</sup> Similarly, <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolutionary_biology\">evolutionary biology</a> grapples with mechanisms driving rapid diversification events like the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Cambrian_explosion\">Cambrian explosion</a> and the persistence of paradoxes such as the plankton species diversity in stable environments. <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Systems_biology\">Systems biology</a> seeks to integrate vast datasets into predictive models of cellular dynamics, addressing how networks maintain <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Homeostasis\">homeostasis</a> amid perturbations like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Disease\">disease</a> or environmental stress.

Collectively, these unsolved problems not only define current frontiers in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biology\">biology</a> but also promise transformative applications in biotechnology, conservation, and human health.</p>\n<h2>Current Research Status</h2>\n<p>Research on unsolved problems in biology continues to advance through interdisciplinary efforts, integrating genomics, computational modeling, and experimental innovations. As of 2015, a review by Brian K. Davis highlighted key challenges including the origin of life, genetic basis of neural specificity, gene regulation in multicellular organisms, constraints on multicellularity, protein folding, stoichiometry, viral evolution, and aging, emphasizing the need for novel theoretical frameworks and empirical data.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[4]</sup> Recent developments up to 2025 have made notable progress in several areas. In the origin of life, studies suggest life may have emerged rapidly on early Earth, with experiments demonstrating self-assembling materials and interactions between RNA molecules and amino acids as potential precursors to biological systems.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[5]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[6]</sup> Evolutionary biology benefits from a &quot;golden age&quot; of species discovery, with over 16,000 new species identified annually, aiding understanding of diversification mechanisms, alongside breakthroughs in human evolution tracing fossil and genetic evidence.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[7]</sup> In molecular biology, advances like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction, though challenges in protein folding dynamics and gene regulation persist, with ongoing research into epigenetic mechanisms and non-coding RNAs.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[8]</sup> These efforts underscore a dynamic field where partial solutions emerge, yet fundamental questions remain open, driving applications in medicine and biotechnology.</p>\n<h2>Origins of Life and Evolution</h2>\n<h3>Origin of Life</h3>\n<p>The origin of life on <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Earth\">Earth</a>, known as <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Abiogenesis\">abiogenesis</a>, remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biology\">biology</a>, involving the transition from abiotic chemistry to self-sustaining, replicating systems capable of Darwinian <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>. This process likely occurred around 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago in a prebiotic environment rich in simple organic molecules, but the exact chemical pathways and conditions that bridged non-living matter to the first protocells are unknown. Key challenges include synthesizing complex biomolecules under plausible <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Early_Earth\">early Earth</a> conditions, achieving stable replication without modern enzymatic support, and establishing the selective pressures that favored life's emergence. Experimental recreations, such as the Miller-Urey experiment simulating primordial atmospheres, have produced <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Amino_acid\">amino acids</a>, and modified versions have also yielded nucleobases and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Nucleotide\">nucleotides</a>, yet scaling these to functional <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biopolymer\">biopolymers</a> eludes researchers.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[9]</sup> Recent modeling as of 2025 suggests that the probability of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Abiogenesis\">abiogenesis</a> via purely random chemical processes is exceedingly low given the limited timeframe, underscoring the role of specific environmental or catalytic factors.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[10]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[11]</sup> A central hypothesis for the transition to self-replicating systems is the RNA world, positing that RNA molecules served dual roles as genetic material and catalysts (ribozymes) before the evolution of DNA and proteins. However, significant limitations persist: prebiotic synthesis of RNA's ribose sugar and nucleotides is inefficient due to instability in aqueous environments, and achieving template-directed replication without protein assistance remains unfeasible in lab settings.

Frameworks emphasizing human-centered <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Risk_assessment\">risk assessment</a> and legal safeguards are proposed, but their implementation lags behind technological advances, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary standards to prevent dual-use misuse. Quantum biology effects in synthetic photosynthesis represent an intriguing yet unresolved frontier, where harnessing coherence and vibronic coupling could boost energy transfer efficiency beyond classical limits, but engineering these phenomena at ambient conditions proves challenging. In natural systems, quantum coherences enable near-100% <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Photon\">photon</a> utilization by allowing excitons to explore multiple pathways simultaneously, yet their physiological role&mdash;whether adaptive or incidental&mdash;remains debated, with simulations indicating persistence but ensemble measurements obscuring single-molecule dynamics. Replicating this in artificial setups, such as biomimetic light-harvesting complexes, faces hurdles in stabilizing quantum states against decoherence from thermal noise and integrating them with synthetic pigments for scalable <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Solar_fuel\">solar fuel</a> production. Vibration-assisted mechanisms for <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Non-photochemical_quenching\">non-photochemical quenching</a> are poorly understood, limiting designs that protect synthetic <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Photosystem\">photosystems</a> from overload without sacrificing yield. Scalability of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Bioreactor\">bioreactor</a> designs for industrial biotech in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Synthetic_biology\">synthetic biology</a> is impeded by inefficiencies in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Mass_transfer\">mass transfer</a> and process control, preventing seamless translation from lab to production scales. Key challenges include optimizing oxygen delivery and mixing in large volumes without imposing <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Shear_stress\">shear stress</a> that damages engineered microbes, leading to yield drops of up to 50% in scaled systems. <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Nutrient\">Nutrient</a> gradients and waste accumulation in continuous-flow reactors disrupt metabolic circuits, while strain engineering struggles with genotype-phenotype disconnects, necessitating costly iterative optimizations. Adapting modular designs for cost-effective, high-density cultures remains unsolved, as current <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Bioreactor\">bioreactor</a>s fail to maintain productivity for complex pathways like those producing biofuels or pharmaceuticals, underscoring the demand for integrated sensor technologies and predictive modeling.</p>\n<h3>Artificial Life and Bioengineering</h3>\n<p>Artificial life and bioengineering seek to bridge biological and technological domains by constructing systems that mimic or extend life's emergent properties, yet numerous fundamental challenges persist in achieving robust, scalable integrations. One central unsolved problem is the creation of life from non-living matter in laboratory settings, particularly through synthetic protocells&mdash;compartmentalized chemical systems capable of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Self-replication\">self-replication</a>, <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Metabolism\">metabolism</a>, and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>. Despite advances in assembling lipid vesicles that encapsulate enzymes for rudimentary metabolic cycles, coupling these processes into autonomous, self-sustaining units remains elusive due to difficulties in maintaining stable boundaries, energy gradients, and error-correcting replication mechanisms under non-equilibrium conditions.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[124]</sup> For instance, bottom-up approaches struggle with integrating information storage, compartmentalization, and replication without external inputs, as highlighted in analyses of minimal cell requirements.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[125]</sup> These challenges echo broader questions in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Synthetic_biology\">synthetic biology</a> about defining minimal criteria for life-like behavior, distinct from natural origins. In digital simulations, <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Artificial_life\">artificial life</a> (ALife) models aim to replicate evolutionary dynamics and adaptive behaviors computationally, but the limits of emulating truly <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Living_systems\">living systems</a> pose significant open problems. Achieving a transition to <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Life-Like\">life-like</a> organization in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/In_silico\">silico</a>&mdash;where digital entities spontaneously form self-replicating, bounded populations that evolve open-endedly&mdash;has not been realized, constrained by computational <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Scalability\">scalability</a> and the inability to fully capture physical contingencies like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Spatial_heterogeneity\">spatial heterogeneity</a> or resource scarcity. Simulating an entire unicellular organism's lifecycle, including all molecular interactions and environmental responses, remains infeasible due to the exponential complexity of biological networks, limiting ALife's ability to predict emergent phenomena beyond simplified toy models. These limitations underscore debates on whether <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Digital_media\">digital media</a> can support the same evolutionary innovations as <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Wet_chemistry\">wet chemistry</a>, with current models excelling in evolutionary algorithms but failing to produce generic, adaptable &quot;living&quot; agents. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and neural prosthetics represent key bioengineering frontiers, yet persistent challenges hinder their clinical translation and long-term efficacy. Developing biocompatible electrodes that maintain stable, high-resolution neural recordings over years is a core unsolved issue, as chronic implants provoke immune responses leading to <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Gliosis\">gliosis</a>, signal degradation, and device failure within months.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[126]</sup> Noninvasive alternatives like EEG suffer from poor <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Spatial_resolution\">spatial resolution</a> and susceptibility to artifacts, while invasive methods struggle with precise decoding of intent for complex motor or sensory tasks, exacerbated by neural plasticity that alters signal patterns post-implantation.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[127]</sup> Integrating somatosensory feedback loops in prosthetics further complicates this, requiring targeted stimulation without eliciting pain or fatigue, a problem rooted in incomplete mapping of cortical representations.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[126]</sup> Hybrid systems that intertwine biological, mechanical, and cultural elements raise profound unsolved questions about the interplay between <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Life\">life</a>, mind, machines, and society. In biohybrid robotics, for example, combining living tissues (e.g., muscle cells) with synthetic scaffolds yields actuators with organic adaptability, but predicting emergent behaviors from nonlinear cell-machine interactions remains challenging, as does ensuring ethical scalability without unintended ecological or social disruptions.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[128]</sup> The potential for such hybrids to evolve cultural influences&mdash;through human-AI-biological feedback loops&mdash;complicates definitions of agency and moral status, with open problems in quantifying how machine-augmented minds might drive evolutionary transitions influenced by societal norms.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[128]</sup> These systems blur boundaries, prompting unresolved debates on whether machine integration can foster novel forms of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Collective_intelligence\">collective intelligence</a> without exacerbating inequalities in access or control. Open problems in synthetic multicellularity and organoids center on engineering stable, functional assemblies that recapitulate developmental hierarchies and intercellular coordination. While organoids derived from stem cells form rudimentary tissue architectures, achieving reproducible vascularization, innervation, and size scaling beyond millimeter scales is unsolved, limited by <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Diffusion\">diffusion</a> constraints and heterogeneous differentiation. Recent advances as of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/2025\">2025</a>, such as perfusable vascular networks and rapid generation of functional vascular organoids, have improved maturation but do not fully address these scaling limitations.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[129]</sup> Synthetic approaches, such as programming <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Yeast\">yeast</a> aggregates for multicellular patterns, face challenges in embedding dynamical modules for symmetry-breaking and fate diversification, preventing predictable transitions from unicellular to organized multicellular states.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[130]</sup> Furthermore, instilling embodied memory or collective decision-making in these systems&mdash;via genetic regulatory networks or bioelectric cues&mdash;remains elusive, hindering applications in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Regenerative_medicine\">regenerative medicine</a> or biocomputing where emergent <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Cognition\">cognition</a> could arise from non-neural interactions.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[130]</sup></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://mariomairal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zachos-F.-E.-Habel-J.-C.-Eds-2011-Biodiversity-Hotspots-Distribution-and-Protection-of-Conservation-Priority-Areas.pdf\">https://mariomairal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zachos-F.-E.-Habel-J.-C.-Eds-2011-Biodiversity-Hotspots-Distribution-and-Protection-of-Conservation-Priority-Areas.pdf</a></li></ol>",

Public support, however, exhibits substantial variation across demographics and nations, strongly correlating with levels of formal education, <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Scientific_literacy\">scientific literacy</a>, and religiosity, where higher religiosity&mdash;particularly fundamentalist interpretations&mdash;tends to reduce acceptance of unguided <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a> in favor of divine intervention or <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Special_creation\">special creation</a>.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[2]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[3]</sup>  In the United States, where cultural and legal controversies over evolution's place in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Education\">education</a> have persisted for over a century, recent surveys reveal divided opinions: a 2024 Gallup poll found 24% of adults accept that humans evolved without divine involvement, 34% believe <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/God\">God</a> directed the process, and 37% adhere to <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Creationism\">creationism</a> positing humans appeared in their present form within the last 10,000 years.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[4]</sup> This contrasts with broader polling, such as Pew Research's 2023-2024 data indicating 80% overall acceptance that humans have evolved over time, though 47% qualify it as guided by a <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Deity\">deity</a>, highlighting how question framing&mdash;whether specifying &quot;<a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a>&quot; or excluding <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Supernatural\">supernatural</a> elements&mdash;affects reported levels.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[5]</sup> Internationally, acceptance is markedly higher in secularized regions like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Western_Europe\">Western Europe</a> and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Japan\">Japan</a>, often exceeding 80%, while remaining lower in highly religious societies such as <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Turkey\">Turkey</a> or parts of the Islamic world, underscoring causal influences of cultural worldview over mere exposure to evidence.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[6]</sup> These disparities fuel ongoing debates, including challenges to evolutionary instruction in schools and efforts by proponents of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Intelligent_design\">intelligent design</a> or young-earth <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Creationism\">creationism</a> to present alternatives, despite <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Scientific_consensus\">scientific consensus</a> rejecting such views as non-falsifiable or contradicted by data.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[7]</sup></p>\n<h2>Scientific Endorsement</h2>\n<h3>Historical Resolutions and Statements Pre-2000</h3>\n<p>Following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's <em><a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/On_the_Origin_of_Species\">On the Origin of Species</a></em>, evolution by <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a> faced notable resistance from established scientists, reflecting the theory's challenge to prevailing views on species fixity and human origins. <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Rudolf_Virchow\">Rudolf Virchow</a>, a pioneering pathologist and president of the German Anthropological Society, opposed core elements of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Darwinism\">Darwinism</a>, dismissing <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a> as unproven and rejecting human descent from apes due to the absence of transitional fossils and empirical validation.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[8]</sup> <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Rudolf_Virchow\">Virchow</a> viewed Darwin's phylogeny as speculative, prioritizing cellular pathology and direct observation over inferred historical processes, though he accepted limited transformism without endorsing selection as the driver.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[9]</sup> This skepticism, shared by other continental figures amid debates on mechanism and evidence, delayed broad endorsement, with acceptance building gradually through accumulating data in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Genetics\">genetics</a> and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Paleontology\">paleontology</a>. By the early <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/20th_century\">20th century</a>, scientific gatherings signaled strengthening support. The 1909 Darwin centennial, organized by the American Association for the Advancement of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Science\">Science</a> (AAAS) during its annual meeting, featured addresses on &quot;modern aspects of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>,&quot; where neo-Darwinian proponents reaffirmed natural selection's role in descent with modification, countering earlier critiques and highlighting empirical advances.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[10]</sup> In 1923, the AAAS formally resolved that organic <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> stood as one of the most robustly evidenced scientific generalizations, backed by tested observations from <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Comparative_anatomy\">comparative anatomy</a>, <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Embryology\">embryology</a>, and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biogeography\">biogeography</a>.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[11]</sup> The mid-20th century saw intensified affirmations amid educational disputes. In 1972, the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/National_Academy_of_Sciences\">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS), alongside the AAAS, urged science curricula to prioritize <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> as a core biological principle, restricting content to empirically derived explanations and excluding non-scientific alternatives.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[11]</sup> During the 1980s, as creationist challenges peaked, organizations issued targeted statements: the NAS's 1981 council resolution delineated <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Science\">science</a> and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Religion\">religion</a> as distinct domains, positioning <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> as the testable framework for life's diversity; the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/American_Chemical_Society\">American Chemical Society</a> declared creationism untestable and data-independent that year; and by 1984, the NAS labeled <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Creation_science\">creation science</a> an empirically unsupported hypothesis unfit for curricula.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[12]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[11]</sup> Similar endorsements from bodies like the Geological Society of America (1983) and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/American_Astronomical_Society\">American Astronomical Society</a> (1982) underscored <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>'s integration across disciplines, grounded in interdisciplinary evidence rather than conjecture.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[11]</sup> These pre-2000 declarations marked a consolidation of consensus, rooted in falsifiable mechanisms and observational rigor, without erasing historical contention.</p>\n<h3>Modern Scientific Consensus and Project Steve</h3>\n<p>In the early 2000s, surveys of scientists reinforced a strong consensus on <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> as the prevailing explanation for biological diversity. A 2015 <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Pew_Research_Center\">Pew Research Center</a> analysis of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) members found that 98% affirmed that &quot;humans and other living things have evolved over time,&quot; with 87% attributing this to natural processes such as <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a>.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[13]</sup> This high level of acceptance reflects <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>'s empirical success in fields like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Genomics\">genomics</a>, where it underpins predictive models for <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Genetic_variation\">genetic variation</a> and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Disease\">disease</a> susceptibility, rather than philosophical agreement on all interpretive details. To highlight this consensus amid attempts to compile lists of dissenting scientists, the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/National_Center_for_Science_Education\">National Center for Science Education</a> (NCSE) launched <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Project_Steve\">Project Steve</a> in February 2003. The project solicits endorsements of a statement affirming <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a>&mdash;&quot;<a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">Evolution</a> is a vital, well-supported <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Scientific_theory\">scientific theory</a>&quot;&mdash;exclusively from scientists named Steve (or variants like Stephen or Stephanie), parodying the limited scale of opposing petitions. By February 2023, it had amassed 1,488 signatories, predominantly with PhDs in relevant fields, and reached approximately 1,500 by early 2025.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[14]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[15]</sup> NCSE estimates that, given Steves comprise about 1% of the population, this implies support from at least 150,000 qualified scientists overall, though the initiative's humorous methodology prioritizes rhetorical illustration over rigorous sampling.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[15]</sup> Such list-based quantifications, including <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Project_Steve\">Project Steve</a>, face critiques for selectivity and lack of representativeness; they neither constitute formal polls nor account for the full spectrum of scientific opinion, which emphasizes evolution's practical utility in research over absolute unanimity. Recent discussions, such as those surrounding the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Extended_evolutionary_synthesis\">extended evolutionary synthesis</a>&mdash;which incorporates mechanisms like developmental plasticity alongside core neo-Darwinian principles&mdash;have not undermined this consensus but rather refined its application, as evidenced by ongoing AAAS endorsements of evolution's foundational role in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biology\">biology</a>. The consensus persists due to evolution's causal <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Explanatory_power\">explanatory power</a> in observable phenomena, such as <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> patterns tracked in clinical data, rather than dogmatic adherence.</p>\n<h3>Documented Scientific Dissent and Critiques</h3>\n<p>The Discovery Institute maintains a public list titled &quot;A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism,&quot; initiated in 2001, comprising over 1,000 scientists with doctoral degrees who express skepticism regarding the sufficiency of random mutation and natural selection to account for macroevolutionary change. Signatories, spanning disciplines including biology, biochemistry, and paleontology, affirm: &quot;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.&quot;<sup data-state=\"closed\">[16]</sup> This list, updated periodically, includes figures such as biochemist Michael Behe, who argues that certain molecular systems exhibit irreducible complexity, defined as structures requiring multiple interdependent parts for function, where the removal of any part renders the system inoperable, posing a challenge to gradual evolutionary assembly. Behe's concept, detailed in molecular examples like the <mark>bacteria</mark>l flagellum, posits that such systems lack viable intermediate forms reducible by stepwise mutation. Empirical gaps in the fossil record, notably the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Cambrian_explosion\">Cambrian explosion</a>&mdash;characterized by the abrupt appearance of diverse animal phyla around 540 million years ago with minimal precursor evidence&mdash;have prompted critiques questioning neo-Darwinian gradualism.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[17]</sup> Paleontological analyses highlight the rapid diversification of body plans within a geologically brief interval, conflicting with expectations of slow, incremental change driven by mutation and selection.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[18]</sup> Similarly, the prevalence of orphan genes&mdash;protein-coding sequences lacking detectable homologs in other species, comprising up to 10-30% of genomes in various taxa&mdash;challenges models reliant on <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Gene_duplication\">gene duplication</a> and divergence as primary innovation mechanisms, as de novo origination rates appear comparable or higher, implying novel functional genes arise without clear ancestral precursors.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[19]</sup> Phylostratigraphic studies indicate these taxonomically restricted genes contribute to lineage-specific adaptations, complicating universal <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Common_descent\">common descent</a> narratives.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[20]</sup> Quantitative assessments underscore probabilistic constraints on macroevolutionary transitions, as articulated in Behe's analysis of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Mutation\">mutation</a> rates and waiting times for coordinated changes, such as multiple simultaneous beneficial <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/The_Mutations\">mutations</a> required for <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Complex_traits\">complex traits</a>, which exceed plausible evolutionary timescales based on observed microbial evolution limits. In <em>The Edge of Evolution</em> (2007), Behe calculates that events demanding two or more specific <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/The_Mutations\">mutations</a> simultaneously, like chloroquine resistance in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Malaria\">malaria</a> parasites, occur rarely enough to delimit the scope of unguided processes for innovations like multicellularity or novel cell types. <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Systems_biology\">Systems biology</a> approaches, integrating genomic, proteomic, and network data, further reveal neo-Darwinism's limitations in explanatory power for developmental and regulatory complexity, prompting calls to incorporate constructive neutral evolution and network rewiring over selection-dominated models.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[21]</sup> A 2014 <em>Nature</em> commentary by evolutionary biologists Kevin Laland and colleagues argued for rethinking core tenets of the modern synthesis, advocating an extended evolutionary framework to address constructive processes like plasticity, niche construction, and developmental bias that <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Neo-Darwinism\">neo-Darwinism</a> marginalizes.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[22]</sup> Subsequent discussions, including 2022-2025 reviews, highlight persistent evidential deficits in origin-of-life transitions and macroevolutionary pattern prediction, with dissenters exerting influence in subfields like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Computational_biology\">computational biology</a> despite comprising an estimated 2-5% of biologists.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[23]</sup> These critiques emphasize causal mechanisms grounded in empirical improbability and informational barriers, rather than dismissing evolution outright, and persist amid institutional pressures documented by signatories fearing professional repercussions.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[24]</sup></p>\n<h2>Support from Applied Sciences and Industry</h2>\n<h3>Medical and Genetic Applications</h3>\n<p>The emergence of <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> in <mark>bacteria</mark>l <mark>pathogens</mark> illustrates microevolutionary dynamics directly impacting medical practice. Since the introduction of penicillin in 1941, selective pressure from widespread antibiotic use has driven mutations conferring resistance, resulting in <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> strains responsible for over 2.8 million <mark>infection</mark>s and 35,000 deaths annually in the United States as of 2019 data extrapolated to ongoing trends.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[25]</sup> Evolutionary models predict resistance trajectories by analyzing genetic costs and trade-offs, such as reduced fitness in antibiotic-free environments, informing stewardship programs that cycle antibiotics to minimize selection for resistant variants.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[26]</sup> These applications underscore evolution's utility in anticipating clinical challenges without relying on unobservable long-term transformations. Viral evolution, particularly in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/SARS-CoV-2\">SARS-CoV-2</a> from 2020 to 2025, provides empirical evidence of adaptive changes guiding therapeutic and vaccine strategies.

Despite over a century of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Research\">research</a>, laboratory experiments have failed to produce self-replicating systems from prebiotic chemicals under plausible <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Early_Earth\">early Earth</a> conditions, with key challenges including the formation of stable polymers, resolution of <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Chirality\">chirality</a> (<a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Homochirality\">homochirality</a>), and the origin of specified information in genetic molecules. A 2025 analysis highlights formidable entropic and informational barriers to assembling a viable <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Protocell\">protocell</a> within Earth's habitable window, estimating the probabilistic hurdles as &quot;mind-bending&quot; and underscoring the rarity of spontaneous organization into functional proto-life. Empirical gaps persist in extrapolating <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Microevolution\">microevolution</a>&mdash;observed small-scale changes like <mark>bacteria</mark>l resistance to antibiotics&mdash;to <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Macroevolution\">macroevolution</a>, which posits large-scale innovations such as novel body plans or tissue types. The fossil record frequently exhibits long-term stasis, where species morphologies remain largely unchanged for millions of years, rather than the gradual accumulation expected from microevolutionary rates, challenging simplistic genetic extrapolations. Peer-reviewed models attempting to reconcile microevolutionary processes with macro patterns acknowledge that abrupt phenotypic shifts and stasis in the record contradict uniform <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Gradualism\">gradualism</a>, as microevolution alone inadequately predicts macro-scale diversification over geological time.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[123]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[124]</sup> Recent genomic studies document rapid adaptive changes in humans, such as selection for lighter skin pigmentation and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Lactase_persistence\">lactase persistence</a> within the last 10,000 years, driven by regulatory <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/The_Mutations\">mutations</a> rather than novel protein functions. However, these microevolutionary adjustments contrast sharply with pervasive stasis in the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Fossil\">fossil</a> record, where many lineages show minimal morphological <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> over tens of millions of years, as evidenced by genomic signatures in &quot;living fossils&quot; and paleontological analyses. This discrepancy raises questions about the scalability of observed rapid shifts to explain macroevolutionary transitions, particularly given the absence of intermediate forms bridging major discontinuities.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[125]</sup> Probabilistic critiques further highlight temporal constraints, with mathematical models demonstrating that the waiting time for multiple coordinated beneficial <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/The_Mutations\">mutations</a>&mdash;necessary for complex adaptations&mdash;exceeds available evolutionary timelines. For instance, calculations for two specific mutations required simultaneously in a mammalian <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Population\">population</a> yield expected waiting periods of hundreds of millions of years, far surpassing the divergence times inferred for key events like <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Malaria\">malaria</a> resistance in humans. Such analyses, grounded in <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Population_genetics\">population genetics</a> and mutation rates, indicate that the cumulative probability of successive rare beneficial changes aligns poorly with Earth's 4.5-billion-year history for originating high-complexity features.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[126]</sup></p>\n<h3>Cultural and Institutional Factors Suppressing Dissent</h3>\n<p>In academic <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Biology\">biology</a> departments, dissent from neo-Darwinian <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Evolution\">evolution</a> has incurred significant professional risks, including denial of tenure and institutional ostracism.

This mechanism was exercised in May 2025 when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. directed all Cabinet secretaries to submit courtesy resignations amid post-midterm election assessments of performance. Such removals underscore the President's discretion in ensuring alignment with administration priorities, absent formal qualifications beyond confirmation by the <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Commission_on_Appointments\">Commission on Appointments</a> for certain appointees.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[23]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[24]</sup> Congressional oversight operates through legislative committees that summon the Secretary for hearings, budget reviews, and policy evaluations, enforcing accountability via public scrutiny and potential legislative remedies. The Senate Committee on Health and Demography and the House Committee on Health, for example, monitor implementation of laws like the Universal Health Care Act, with joint oversight committees empowered to assess compliance and recommend adjustments. In August 2021, Senator Grace Poe invoked this during a blue ribbon committee probe into Department of Health procurement lapses under Secretary Francisco Duque III, highlighting failures in vaccine distribution and fund management.

Cases against <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Health\">health</a> secretaries include 2025 complaints against Secretary Teodoro Herbosa for authorizing P44.6 million in unauthorized medical assistance payments, prompting <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Ombudsman\">Ombudsman</a> review without immediate suspension, and reevaluation of Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corp. procurement scandals involving Duque, where overpriced <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> supplies led to graft charges under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

COA flagged P59.6 billion in uncollected hospital claims in 2023 reports and urged DOH to pursue receivables from PhilHealth, while addressing 2024 findings on accountable forms and procurement compliance. Non-compliance can result in personal liability for the Secretary and subordinates, with COA recommendations often feeding into Ombudsman or congressional actions for systemic reforms.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[30]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[31]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[32]</sup> Unlike impeachable officials such as the President or <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Supreme_court\">Supreme Court</a> justices, the Secretary faces no impeachment process, limiting removal to presidential discretion or <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Ombudsman\">Ombudsman</a> sanctions.

Mass testing was initially restricted to persons under investigation (PUIs) with symptoms until <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/March_20\">March 20</a>, 2020, with broader efforts only commencing on April 14, 2020, despite calls for earlier expansion; testing targets of 30,000 swabs per day remained unmet due to limited capacity and selective prioritization. Duque later apologized for not providing equal support to regional testing laboratories, acknowledging this as a shortfall that hindered nationwide detection. These delays contributed to surveillance gaps, as limited testing capacity affected timely case identification and <a data-state=\"closed\" href=\"https://grokipedia.com/page/Contact_tracing\">contact tracing</a>, which Duque described as a &quot;dead end&quot; as early as February 4, 2020.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[123]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[124]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[123]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[125]</sup> Procurement failures exacerbated frontline vulnerabilities, with delayed acquisition of personal protective equipment (PPE) leaving health workers to improvise using items like laundry gloves and grocery bags amid reported shortages. The DOH purchased PPE at inflated prices, such as P1,800 per set against a market range of P400 to P1,000, prompting Ombudsman investigations into Duque and officials for negligence in expediting supplies. The Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corp. scandal further highlighted irregularities, as the firm&mdash;lacking prior experience&mdash;secured P11 billion in DOH contracts for overpriced COVID-19 supplies between March 2020 and July 2021, amid global shortages that the government failed to mitigate through local production incentives. Auditors identified deficiencies in the handling of COVID-19 funds, including unspent allocations for pandemic response, underscoring mismanagement despite available Bayanihan emergency budgets.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[123]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[126]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[127]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[119]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[128]</sup> Vaccine rollout efforts were hampered by procurement delays, with the Philippines securing initial doses only in late December 2020&mdash;among the last in Southeast Asia&mdash;despite opportunities for earlier deals like Pfizer as of January 2021, which Duque's team failed to pursue aggressively. Critics attributed this to bureaucratic inertia and over-reliance on COVAX allocations, amid global supply constraints that Duque cited but which senators deemed insufficient justification for the lag. Public vaccination proceeded slowly, with hesitancy compounded by DOH messaging inconsistencies, such as Duque's retracted announcement of a second wave on May 20, 2020, eroding trust.<sup data-state=\"closed\">[129]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[130]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[131]</sup><sup data-state=\"closed\">[123]</sup> Empirical data revealed substantial underreporting of COVID-19 impacts, with official 2021 deaths capturing only about 20% of estimated excess mortality of 212,900 all-cause deaths (193 per 100,000 population), peaking in September 2021; this discrepancy arose from testing limitations and indirect effects like disruptions in care for non-COVID conditions. Duque admitted personal shortcomings on April 17, 2020, citing inexperience with pandemics and lack of foresight, amid 14 senators' calls for his resignation over perceived negligence.

Allen Orr) of <em>Speciation</em>.</p>\n<p>[Editor's Note: First published in <em>The New Republic </em>on August 22nd]</p>\n<p>THE CASE AGAINST INTELLIGENT DESIGN</p>\n<p>Exactly eighty years after the Scopes &quot;monkey trial&quot; in Dayton, Tennessee, history is about to repeat itself. In a courtroom in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in late September, scientists and creationists will square off about whether and how high school students in Dover, Pennsylvania will learn about biological evolution. One would have assumed that these battles were over, but that is to underestimate the fury (and the ingenuity) of creationists scorned.</p>\n<p>The Scopes trial of our day &mdash; Kitzmiller, et al v. Dover Area School District et al &mdash; began innocuously. In the spring of 2004, the district's textbook review committee recommended that a new commercial text replace the outdated biology book. At a school board meeting in June, William Buckingham, the chair of the board's curriculum committee, complained that the proposed replacement book was &quot;laced with Darwinism.&quot; After challenging the audience to trace its roots back to a monkey, he suggested that a more suitable textbook would include biblical theories of creation. When asked whether this might offend those of other faiths, Buckingham replied, &quot;This country wasn't founded on Muslim beliefs or evolution. This country was founded on Christianity and our students should be taught as such.&quot; Defending his views a week later, Buckingham reportedly pleaded: &quot;Two thousand years ago, someone died on a cross. Can't someone take a stand for him?&quot; And he added: &quot;Nowhere in the Constitution does it call for a separation of church and state.&quot;</p>\n<p>After a summer of heated but inconclusive wrangling, on October 18, 2004 the Dover school board passed, by a vote of six to three, a resolution that read: &quot;Students will be made aware of gaps/problems in Darwin's theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design. Note: Origins of Life is not taught.&quot; A month later, the Dover school district issued a press release revealing how the alternative of &quot;intelligent design&quot; was to be presented. Before starting to teach evolution, biology teachers were to read their ninth-grade students a statement, which included the following language:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin's Theory of Evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part.</p> <p>Because Darwin's Theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The Theory is not a fact. Gaps in the Theory exist for which there is no evidence.... Intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book, Of Pandas and People , is available for students to see if they would like to explore this view in an effort to gain an understanding of what intelligent design actually involves. As is true with any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The results were dramatic but predictable. Two school board members resigned. All eight science teachers at Dover High School sent a letter to the school superintendent pointing out that &quot;intelligent design is not science. It is not biology. It is not an accepted scientific theory.&quot; The biology teachers asked to be excused from reading the statement, claiming that to do so would &quot;knowingly and intentionally misrepresent subject matter or curriculum,&quot; a violation of their code of professional standards. And so, in January of this year, all ninth-grade biology classes were visited by the assistant superintendent himself, who read the mandated disclaimer while the teachers and a few students left the room.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, the controversy went to the courts. Eleven Dover parents filed suit against the school district and its board of directors, asking that the &quot;intelligent design&quot; policy be rescinded for fostering &quot;excessive entanglement of government and religion, coerced religious instruction, and an endorsement by the state of religion over non-religion and of one religious viewpoint over others.&quot; The plaintiffs are represented by the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper Hamilton, the Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State; the defendants, by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian organization in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>\n<p>Why all the fuss about a seemingly inoffensive statement? Who could possibly object to students &quot;keep[ing] an open mind&quot; and examining a respectable-sounding alternative to evolution? Isn't science about testing theories against each other? The furor makes sense only in light of the tortuous history of creationism in America. Since it arose after World War I, Christian fundamentalist creationism has undergone its own evolution, taking on newer forms after absorbing repeated blows from the courts. &quot;Intelligent design,&quot; as I will show, is merely the latest incarnation of the biblical creationism espoused by William Jennings Bryan in Dayton. Far from a respectable scientific alternative to evolution, it is a clever attempt to sneak religion, cloaked in the guise of science, into the public schools.</p>\n<p>The journey from Dayton to Dover was marked by a series of legal verdicts, only one of which, the Scopes trial, favored creationism. In 1925, John Scopes, a high school teacher, was convicted of violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of &quot;any theory that denies the Story of Divine Creation of Man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animal.&quot; The verdict was reversed on a technicality (the judge, instead of the jury, levied the $100 fine), so the case was never appealed. In the wake of Scopes, anti-evolution laws were passed in Mississippi and Arkansas, adding to those passed by Florida and Oklahoma in 1923. Although these laws were rarely enforced, evolution nonetheless quickly disappeared from most high school biology textbooks because publishers feared losing sales in the South, where anti-evolution sentiment ran high.</p>\n<p>In 1957, the situation changed. With the launch of Sputnik, Americans awoke to find that a scientifically advanced Soviet Union had beaten the United States into space. This spurred rapid revisions of science textbooks, some emphasizing biological evolution. But the anti-evolution statutes were still in force, and so some teachers using newer books were violating the law. One of these teachers, Susan Epperson, brought suit against the state of Arkansas for violating the Establishment Clause. She won the right to teach evolution, and Epperson v. Arkansas was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1968, only a year after Tennessee finally rescinded the Butler Act. Finally it was legal to teach evolution everywhere in America.</p>\n<p>The opponents of evolution proceeded to re-think their strategy, deciding that if they could not beat scientists, they would join them. They thus recast themselves as &quot;scientific creationists,&quot; proposing an ostensibly non-religious alternative to the theory of evolution that might be acceptable in the classroom. But the empirical claims of scientific creationism &oacute; that the Earth is young (6,000 to 10,000 years old), that all species were created suddenly and simultaneously, that mass extinctions were caused by a great worldwide flood &oacute; bore a suspicious resemblance to creation stories in the Bible. This strategy was devised largely by Henry Morris, an engineering professor who headed the influential Institute for Creation Research in San Diego and helped to write the Scientific Creationism. The book came in two versions: one purged of religious references for the public schools, the other containing a scriptural appendix explaining that the science came from interpreting the Bible literally.</p>\n<p>Scientific creationism proved a bust for two reasons. First, the &quot;science&quot; was ludicrously wrong. We have known for a long time that the Earth is 4.6 billion years old (the 6,000- to 10,000-year claim comes from biblical statements, including toting up the number of &quot;begats&quot;) and that species were not created suddenly or simultaneously (not only do most species go extinct, but various groups appear at different times in the fossil record), and we have ample evidence for species' changing over time, as well as for fossils that illustrate large morphological transformations. Most risible wasScientific Creationism's struggle to explain the geological record as a result of a great flood: according to its account, &quot;primitive&quot; organisms such as fish would be found in the lowest layers, while mammals and more &quot;advanced&quot; species appeared in higher layers because they climbed hills and mountains to escape the rising waters. Why dolphins are found in the upper strata with other mammals is one of many facts that this ludicrous fantasy fails to explain.</p>\n<p>Scientific creationism also came to grief because its advocates did not adequately hide its religious underpinnings. In 1981, the Arkansas legislature passed an &quot;equal time&quot; bill mandating balanced treatment for &quot;evolution science&quot; and &quot;creation science&quot; in the classroom. The bill was quickly challenged in federal court by a group of religious and scientific plaintiffs led by a Methodist minister named William McLean. The defense was easily outgunned, with Judge William Overton quickly spotting biblical literalism underlying the scientific-creationist arguments. In a landmark opinion (and a masterpiece of legal argument), Overton ruled in McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education that the balanced-treatment act was unconstitutional, asserting that it violated the Establishment Clause in three ways: it lacked a secular legislative purpose, its primary effect was to advance religion, and it fostered excessive government entanglement with religion.</p>\n<p>McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education began a string of legal setbacks for scientific creationists. Five years later, in Edwards v. Aguillard, the Supreme Court held that Louisiana's &quot;Creationism Act&quot; &oacute; an act that required the teaching of evolution in public schools to be balanced by instruction in &quot;creation science&quot; &oacute; was unconstitutional. In the last two decades, federal courts have also used the First Amendment to allow schools to prohibit teaching creationism and to ban school districts from requiring teachers to read evolution disclaimers similar to the one used in Dover, Pennsylvania. To get around these rulings, schools in Alabama, Arkansas, and Georgia began pasting warning stickers in biology textbooks, as if learning about evolution could endanger one's mental health. A recent specimen from Cobb County, Georgia reads: &quot;This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.&quot;</p>\n<p>To laypeople &mdash; particularly those unfamiliar with the scientific status of evolution, which is actually a theory and a fact &mdash; the phrasing may seem harmless. But in 2005 a federal judge ordered the stickers removed. By singling out evolution as uniquely controversial among scientific theories, the stickers catered to religious biases and thus violated the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>But the creationists did not despair. They are animated, after all, by faith. And they are very resourceful. They came up with intelligent design.</p>\n<p>II.</p>\n<p>Intelligent design, or ID, is the latest pseudoscientific incarnation of religious creationism, cleverly crafted by a new group of enthusiasts to circumvent recent legal restrictions. ID comes in two parts. The first is a simple critique of evolutionary theory, to the effect that Darwinism, as an explanation of the origin, the development, and the diversity of life, is fatally flawed. The second is the assertion that the major features of life are best understood as the result of creation by a supernatural intelligent designer. To understand ID, then, we must first understand modern evolutionary theory (often called &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; to take into account post-Darwinian modifications).</p>\n<p>It is important to realize at the outset that evolution is not &quot;just a theory.&quot; It is, again, a theory and a fact. Although non-scientists often equate &quot;theory&quot; with &quot;hunch&quot; or &quot;wild guess,&quot; the Oxford English Dictionary defines a scientific theory as &quot;a scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts.&quot; In science, a theory is a convincing explanation for a diversity of data from nature. Thus scientists speak of &quot;atomic theory&quot; and &quot;gravitational theory&quot; as explanations for the properties of matter and the mutual attraction of physical bodies. It makes as little sense to doubt the factuality of evolution as to doubt the factuality of gravity.</p>\n<p>Neo-Darwinian theory is not one proposition but several. The first proposition is that populations of organisms have evolved. (Darwin, who used the word &quot;evolved&quot; only once in On the Origin of Species, called this principle &quot;descent with modification.&quot;) That is, the species on earth today are the descendants of other species that lived earlier, and the change in these lineages has been gradual, taking thousands to millions of years. Humans, for example, evolved from distinctly different organisms that had smaller brains and probably lived in trees.</p>\n<p>The second proposition is that new forms of life are continually generated by the splitting of a single lineage into two or more lineages. This is known as &quot;speciation.&quot; About five million years ago, a species of primates split into two distinct lineages: one leading to modern chimpanzees and the other to modern humans. And this ancestral primate itself shared a common ancestor with earlier primates, which in turn shared a common ancestor with other mammals. The earlier ancestor of all mammals shared an even earlier ancestor with reptiles, and so on back to the origin of life. Such successive splitting yields the common metaphor of an evolutionary &quot;tree of life,&quot; whose root was the first species to arise and whose twigs are the millions of living species. Any two extant species share a common ancestor, which can in principle be found by tracing that pair of twigs back through the branches to the node where they meet. (Extinction, of course, has pruned some branches &oacute; pterodactyls, for example &oacute; which represent groups that died off without descendants.) We are more closely related to chimpanzees than to orangutans because our common ancestor with these primates lived five million versus ten million years ago, respectively. (It is important to note that although we share a common ancestor with apes, we did not evolve from living apes, but from apelike species that no longer exist. Similarly, I am related to my cousin, but the ancestors we share are two extinct grandparents.)</p>\n<p>The third proposition is that most (though not all) of evolutionary change is probably driven by natural selection: individuals carrying genes that better suit them to the current environment leave more offspring than individuals carrying genes that make them less adapted. Over time, the genetic composition of a population changes, improving its &quot;fit&quot; to the environment. This increasing fit is what gives organisms the appearance of design, although, as we shall see, the &quot;design&quot; can be flawed.</p>\n<p>These three propositions were first articulated in 1859 by Darwin in On the Origin of Species, and they have not changed substantially, although they have been refined and supplemented by modern work. But Darwin did not propose these ideas as pure &quot;theory&quot;; he also provided voluminous and convincing evidence for them. The weight of this evidence was so overwhelming that it crushed creationism. Within fifteen years, nearly all biologists, previously adherents of &quot;natural theology,&quot; abandoned that view and accepted Darwin's first two propositions. Broad acceptance of natural selection came much later, around 1930.</p>\n<p>The overwhelming evidence for evolution can be found in many books (and on many websites). Here I wish to present just a few observations that not only support the neo-Darwinist account, but in so doing refute the alternative theory of creationism &oacute; that God specially created organisms and their attributes. Given the similarity between the claims of intelligent design and creationism, it is not surprising that these observations also refute the major tenets of ID.</p>\n<p>The fossil record is the most obvious place to search for evidence of evolution. Although the record was sparse in Darwin's time, there were already findings that suggested evolution. The living armadillos of South America bore a striking resemblance to fossil glyptodonts, extinct armored mammals whose fossils occurred in the same area. This suggested that glyptodonts and armadillos shared a common South American ancestry. And the record clearly displayed changes in the forms of life existing over large spans of time, with the deepest and oldest sediments showing marine invertebrates, with fishes appearing much later, and still later amphibians, reptiles, and mammals (along with the persistence of some groups found in earlier stages). This sequence of change was in fact established by creationist geologists long before Darwin, and was often thought to reflect hundreds of acts of divine creation. (This does not exactly comport with the account given in Genesis.)</p>\n<p>Yet evolution predicts not just successions of forms, but also genetic lineages from ancestors to descendants. The absence of such transitional series in the fossil record bothered Darwin, who called this &quot;the most obvious and serious objection that can be urged against the theory.&quot; (He attributed the missing links, quite reasonably, to the imperfection of the fossil record and the dearth of paleontological collections.) But this objection is no longer valid. Since 1859, paleontologists have turned up Darwin's missing evidence: fossils in profusion, with many sequences showing evolutionary change. In large and small organisms, we can trace, through successive layers of the fossil record, evolutionary changes occurring in lineages. Diatoms get bigger, clamshells get ribbier, horses get larger and toothier, and the human lineage evolves bigger brains, smaller teeth, and increased efficiency at bipedal walking. Moreover, we now have transitional forms connecting major groups of organisms, including fish with tetrapods, dinosaurs with birds, reptiles with mammals, and land mammals with whales. Darwin predicted that such forms would be found, and their discovery vindicated him fully. It also destroys the creationist notion that species were created in their present form and thereafter remained unchanged.</p>\n<p>Darwin's second line of evidence comprised the developmental and structural remnants of past ancestry that we find in living species &oacute; those features that Stephen Jay Gould called &quot;the senseless signs of history.&quot; Examples are numerous. Both birds and toothless anteaters develop tooth buds as embryos, but the teeth are aborted and never erupt; the buds are the remnants of the teeth of the reptilian ancestor of birds and the toothed ancestor of anteaters. The flightless kiwi bird of New Zealand, familiar from shoe-polish cans, has tiny vestigial wings hidden under its feathers; they are completely useless, but they attest to the fact that kiwis, like all flightless birds, evolved from flying ancestors. Some cave animals, descended from sighted ancestors that invaded caves, have rudimentary eyes that cannot see; the eyes degenerated after they were no longer needed. A creator, especially an intelligent one, would not bestow useless tooth buds, wings, or eyes on large numbers of species.</p>\n<p>The human body is also a palimpsest of our ancestry. Our appendix is the vestigial remnant of an intestinal pouch used to ferment the hard-to-digest plant diets of our ancestors. (Orangutans and grazing animals have a large hollow appendix instead of the tiny, wormlike one that we possess.) An appendix is simply a bad thing to have. It is certainly not the product of intelligent design: how many humans died of appendicitis before surgery was invented? And consider also lanugo. Five months after conception, human fetuses grow a thin coat of hair, called lanugo, all over their bodies. It does not seem useful &oacute; after all, it is a comfortable 98.6 degrees in utero &oacute; and the hair is usually shed shortly before birth. The feature makes sense only as an evolutionary remnant of our primate ancestry; fetal apes also grow such a coat, but they do not shed it.</p>\n<p>Recent studies of the human genome provide more evidence that we were not created ex nihilo. Our genome is a veritable Gemisch of non-functional DNA, including many inactive &quot;pseudogenes&quot; that were functional in our ancestors. Why do humans, unlike most mammals, require vitamin C in our diet? Because primates cannot synthesize this essential nutrient from simpler chemicals. Yet we still carry all the genes for synthesizing vitamin C. The gene used for the last step in this pathway was inactivated by mutations forty million years ago, probably because it was unnecessary in fruit-eating primates. But it still sits in our DNA, one of many useless remnants testifying to our evolutionary ancestry.</p>\n<p>Darwin's third line of evidence came from biogeography, the study of the geographic distribution of plants and animals. I have already mentioned what Darwin called his &quot;Law of Succession&quot;: living organisms in an area most closely resemble fossils found in the same location. This implies that the former evolved from the latter. But Darwin found his strongest evidence on &quot;oceanic islands&quot; &oacute; those islands, such as Hawaii and the Gal&middot;pagos, that were never connected to continents but arose, bereft of life, from beneath the sea.</p>\n<p>What struck Darwin about oceanic islands &oacute; as opposed to continents or &quot;continental islands&quot; such as Great Britain, which were once connected to continents &oacute; was the bizarre nature of their flora and fauna. Oceanic islands are simply missing or impoverished in many types of animals. Hawaii has no native mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. These animals, as well as freshwater fish, are also missing on St. Helena, a remote oceanic island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. It seems that the intelligent designer forgot to stock oceanic (but not continental!) islands with a sufficient variety of animals. One might respond that this was a strategy of the creator, as those organisms might not survive on islands. But this objection fails, because such animals often do spectacularly well when introduced by humans. Hawaii has been overrun by the introduced cane toad and mongoose, to the detriment of its native fauna.</p>\n<p>Strikingly, the native groups that are present on these islands &oacute; mainly plants, insects, and birds &oacute; are present in profusion, consisting of clusters of numerous similar species. The Gal&middot;pagos archipelago harbors twenty-three species of land birds, of which fourteen species are finches. Nowhere else in the world will you find an area in which two-thirds of the birds are finches. Hawaii has similar &quot;radiations&quot; of fruit flies and silversword plants, while St. Helena is overloaded with ferns and weevils. Compared with continents or continental islands, then, oceanic islands have unbalanced flora and fauna, lacking many familiar groups but having an over-representation of some species.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the animals and the plants inhabiting oceanic islands bear the greatest similarity to species found on the nearest mainland. As Darwin noted when describing the species of the Gal&middot;pagos, this similarity occurs despite a great difference in habitat, a fact militating against creationism:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Gal&middot;pagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>As the final peg in Darwin's biogeographic argument, he noted that the kinds of organisms commonly found on oceanic islands &oacute; birds, plants, and insects &oacute; are those that can easily get there. Insects and birds can fly to islands (or be blown there by winds), and the seeds of plants can be transported by winds or ocean currents, or in the stomachs of birds. Hawaii may have no native terrestrial mammals, but the islands do harbor one native aquatic mammal, the monk seal, and one native flying mammal, the hoary bat. In a direct challenge to creationists (and now also to advocates of ID), Darwin posed this rhetorical question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands?</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The answer is that the creative force did not produce bats, or any other creatures, on oceanic islands. All of Darwin's observations about island biogeography point to one explanation: species on islands descend from individuals who successfully colonized from the mainland and subsequently evolved into new species. Only the theory of evolution explains the paucity of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and freshwater fish on oceanic islands (they cannot get there), the radiation of some groups into many species (the few species that make it to islands find empty niches and speciate profusely), and the resemblance of island species to those from the nearest mainland (an island colonist is most likely to have come from the closest source).</p>\n<p>In the last 150 years, immense amounts of new evidence have been collected about biogeography, embryology, and, especially, the fossil record. All of it supports evolution. But support for the idea of natural selection was not so strong, and Darwin had no direct evidence for it. He relied instead on two arguments. The first was logical. If individuals in a population varied genetically (which they do), and some of this variation affected the individual's chance of leaving descendants (which seems likely), then natural selection would work automatically, enriching the population in genes that better adapted individuals to their environment.</p>\n<p>The second argument was analogical. Artificial selection used by breeders had wrought immense changes in plants and animals, a fact familiar to everyone. From the ancestral wolf, humans selected forms as diverse as Chihuahuas, St. Bernards, poodles, and bulldogs. Starting with wild cabbage, breeders produced domestic cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi, kale, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. Artificial selection is nearly identical to natural selection, except that humans rather than the environment determine which variants leave offspring. And if artificial selection can produce such a diversity of domesticated plants and animals in a thousand-odd years, natural selection could obviously do much more over millions of years.</p>\n<p>But we no longer need to buttress natural selection solely with analogy and logic. Biologists have now observed hundreds of cases of natural selection, beginning with the well-known examples of <mark>bacteria</mark>l resistance to antibiotics, insect resistance to DDT, and HIV resistance to antiviral drugs. Natural selection accounts for the resistance of fish and mice to predators by making them more camouflaged, and for the adaptation of plants to toxic minerals in the soil. (A long list of examples may be found in Natural Selection in the Wild, by John Endler.) Moreover, the strength of selection observed in the wild, when extrapolated over long periods, is more than adequate to explain the diversification of life on Earth.</p>\n<p>Since 1859, Darwin's theories have been expanded, and we now know that some evolutionary change can be caused by forces other than natural selection. For example, random and non-adaptive changes in the frequencies of different genetic variants &oacute; the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing &oacute; have produced evolutionary changes in DNA sequences. Yet selection is still the only known evolutionary force that can produce the fit between organism and environment (or between organism and organism) that makes nature seem &quot;designed.&quot; As the geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky remarked, &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.&quot;</p>\n<p>And so evolution has graduated from theory to fact. We know that species on earth today descended from earlier, different species, and that every pair of species had a common ancestor that existed in the past. Most evolutionary change in the features of organisms, moreover, is almost certainly the result of natural selection. But we must also remember that, like all scientific truths, the truth of evolution is provisional: it could conceivably be overturned by future investigations. It is possible (but unlikely!) that we could find human fossils co-existing with dinosaurs, or fossils of birds living alongside those of the earliest invertebrates 600 million years ago. Either observation would sink neo-Darwinism for good.</p>\n<p>When applied to evolution, the erroneous distinction between theory and fact shows why tactics such as the Dover disclaimer and the Cobb County textbook sticker are doubly pernicious. To teach that a scientific theory is equivalent to a &quot;guess&quot; or a &quot;hunch&quot; is deeply misleading, and to assert that &quot;evolution is a theory, not a fact&quot; is simply false. And why should evolution, alone among scientific theories, be singled out with the caveat &quot;This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered&quot;? Why haven't school boards put similar warnings in physics textbooks, noting that gravity and electrons are only theories, not facts, and should be critically considered? After all, nobody has ever seen gravity or an electron. The reason that evolution stands alone is clear: other scientific theories do not offend religious sensibilities.</p>\n<p>III.</p>\n<p>Given the copious evidence for evolution, it seems unlikely that it will be replaced by an alternative theory. But that is exactly what intelligent-design creationists are demanding. Is there some dramatic new evidence, then, or some insufficiency of neo-Darwinism, that warrants overturning the theory of evolution?</p>\n<p>The question is worth asking, but the answer is no. Intelligent design is simply the third attempt of creationists to proselytize our children at the expense of good science and clear thinking. Having failed to ban evolution from schools, and later to get equal classroom time for scientific creationism, they have made a few adjustments designed to sneak Christian cosmogony past the First Amendment. And these adjustments have given ID a popularity never enjoyed by earlier forms of creationism. Even the president of the United States has lent a sympathetic ear: George W. Bush recently told reporters in Texas that intelligent design should be taught in public schools alongside evolution because &quot;part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought.&quot; Articles by IDers, or about their &quot;theory,&quot; regularly appear in mainstream publications such as The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Why have the new image and the new approach been more successful? For a start, IDers have duped many people by further removing God from the picture, or at least hiding him behind the frame. No longer do creationists mention a deity, or even a creator, but simply a neutral-sounding &quot;intelligent designer,&quot; as if it were not the same thing. This designer could in principle be Brahma, or the Taoist P'an Ku, or even a space alien; but ID creationists, as will be evident to anybody who attends to all that they say, mean only one entity: the biblical God. Their problem is that invoking this deity in science classes in public schools is unconstitutional. So IDers never refer openly to God, and people unfamiliar with the history of their creationist doctrine might believe that there is a real scientific theory afoot. They use imposing new terms such as &quot;irreducible complexity,&quot; which make their arguments seem more sophisticated than those of earlier creationists.</p>\n<p>In addition, many IDers have more impressive academic credentials than did earlier scientific creationists, whose talks and antics always bore a whiff of the revival meeting. Unlike scientific creationists, many IDers work at secular institutions rather than at Bible schools. IDers work, speak, and write like trained academics; they do not come off as barely repressed evangelists. Their ranks include Phillip Johnson, the most prominent spokesperson for ID, and a retired professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley; Michael Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University; William Dembski, a mathematician-philosopher and the director of the Center for Theology and Science at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; and Jonathan Wells, who has a doctorate in biology from Berkeley.</p>\n<p>All of these proponents, save Johnson, are senior fellows at the Center for Science and Culture (CSC), a division of the Discovery Institute, which is a conservative think tank in Seattle. (Johnson is the &quot;program advisor&quot; to the CSC.) The CSC is the nerve center of the intelligentdesign movement. Its origins are demonstrably religious: as described by the Discovery Institute, the CSC was designed explicitly &quot;to defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural, and political legacies&quot; and &quot;to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.&quot; Between them, these IDers have published more than a dozen books about intelligent design (Johnson alone has produced eight), which in turn have provoked numerous responses by scientists. Let us examine one of their most influential volumes, the textbook called Of Pandas and People . This is the book recommended by the Dover school district as a &quot;reference book&quot; for students interested in learning about intelligent design.</p>\n<p>Of Pandas and People is a textbook designed as an antidote to the evolution segment of high school biology classes. It was first published in 1989. By repackaging and updating a subset of traditional young-earth creationist arguments while avoiding taking a stand on any issues that might divide creationists (such as the age of the Earth), it marked the beginning of the modern intelligent design movement. By presenting the case for ID, it is supposedly designed to give students a &quot;balanced perspective&quot; on evolution. Although the second edition of Pandas is now twelve years old (a third edition, called Design of Life, is in the works), it accurately presents to students the major arguments for ID.</p>\n<p>Pandas carefully avoids mentioning God (except under aliases such as &quot;intelligent designer,&quot; &quot;master intellect,&quot; and so on); but a little digging reveals the book's deep religious roots. One of its authors, Percival Davis, wrote explicitly about his religious beliefs in his book A Case for Creation,co-authored with Wayne Frair: &quot;Truth as God sees it is revealed in the pages of Scripture, and that revelation is therefore more certainly true than any human rationalism. For the creationist, revealed truth controls his view of the universe to at least as great a degree as anything that has been advanced using the scientific method.&quot; Its other author, Dean Kenyon, has written approvingly of scientific creationism.</p>\n<p>Pandas is published by the Haughton Publishing Company of Dallas, a publisher of agricultural books, but the copyright is held by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE) in Richardson, Texas. Although the FTE website scrupulously avoids mentioning religion, its articles of incorporation note with stark clarity that its &quot;primary purpose is both religious and educational, which includes, but is not limited to, proclaiming, preaching, teaching, promoting, broadcasting, disseminating, and otherwise making known the Christian gospel and understanding of the Bible and the light it sheds on the academic and social issues of our day.&quot; In a fund-raising letter for the proposed third edition of Pandas, Jon Buell, president of the FTE, is equally frank about his goals:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will energetically continue to publish and propel these strategic tools in the battle for the minds and hearts of the young.... Yes, most young Americans are exposed to numerous gospel presentations. But the fog of the alien world view deadens their responses. This is why we have to inundate them with a rational, defensible, well-argued Judeo-Christian world view. FTE's carefully-researched books do just that.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Charles Thaxton, the &quot;academic editor&quot; of Pandas , is the director of curriculum research for FTE and a fellow of the CSC. In a proto-ID book on the origin of life, Thaxton argued that &quot;Special Creation by a Creator beyond the cosmos is a plausible view of origin science.&quot;</p>\n<p>Given Pandas' pedigree and the affiliations of its authors, it is not surprising that the book is nothing more than disguised creationism. What is surprising is the transparency of this disguise. Despite the efforts of IDers to come up with new anti-Darwinian arguments, Pandas turns out to be nothing more than recycled scientific creationism, with most of the old arguments buffed up and proffered as new. (Unlike scientific creationism, however, Pandasadopts a studied neutrality toward the facts of astronomy and geology, instead of denying them outright.)</p>\n<p>Pandas' discussion of the Earth's age is a prime example of the book's creationist roots, and of its anti-scientific attitude. If the Earth were young &oacute; say, the 6,000 to 10,000 years old posited by &quot;young earth&quot; biblical creationists &oacute; then evolution would be false. Life simply could not have originated, evolved, and diversified in such a short time. But we now know from several independent and mutually corroborating lines of evidence that the Earth is 4.6 billion years old. All geologists agree on this. So what isPandas' stance on this critical issue? The book merely notes that design proponents &quot;are divided on the issue of the earth's age. Some take the view that the earth's history can be compressed into a framework of thousands of years, while others adhere to the standard old earth chronology.&quot; Well, what's the truth? This equivocation is an attempt to paper over a strong disagreement between young-earth creationists and old-earth creationists, both of whom have marched under the banner of ID. It is typical of creationists to exploit disagreements between evolutionists as proof that neo-Darwinism is dead while at the same time hiding their own disagreements from the public.</p>\n<p>This equivocation about the fundamental fact of Earth's age does not bode well for the textbook's treatment of the fossil record. Indeed, in this area the authors continue their misrepresentations. Their basic premise is the old creationist argument that organisms appeared simultaneously and have remained largely unchanged ever since. Pandas says of the fossil record that &quot;fully formed organisms appear all at once, separated by distinct gaps.&quot; That's not exactly true. Different types of organisms appear in a distinct sequence supporting evolution. The first fossils of living organisms, <mark>bacteria</mark>, appear 3.5 billion years ago, followed two billion years later by algae, the first organisms having true cells with a nucleus containing distinct chromosomes. Then, 600 million years ago, we see the appearance of rudimentary animals with shells, and many soft-bodied marine organisms. Later, in the Cambrian period, about 543 million years ago, a number of groups arose in a relatively short period of time, the so-called &quot;Cambrian explosion.&quot; (&quot;Short period&quot; here means geologically short, in this case 10 million to 30 million years). The Cambrian groups include mollusks, starfish, arthropods, worms, and chordates (including vertebrates). And in some cases, such as worms, modern groups do not just spring into being, but increase in complexity over millions of years.</p>\n<p>Creationists have always made much of the &quot;Cambrian explosion,&quot; and IDers are no exception. The relatively sudden appearance of many groups seems to support the Genesis view of creation. But IDers &mdash; and Pandas &mdash; fail to emphasize several facts. First, the Cambrian explosion was not &quot;sudden&quot;; it took many millions of years. (We still do not understand why many groups originated in even this relatively short time, although it may reflect an artifact: the evolution of easily fossilized hard parts suddenly made organisms capable of being fossilized.) Moreover, the species of the Cambrian are no longer with us, though their descendants are. But over time, nearly every species that ever lived (more than 99 percent of them) has gone extinct without leaving descendants. Finally, many animals and plants do not show up as fossils until well after the Cambrian explosion: bony fishes and land plants first appeared around 440 million years ago, reptiles around 350 million years ago, mammals around 250 million years ago, flowering plants around 210 million years ago, and human ancestors around 5 million years ago. The staggered appearance of groups that become very different over the next 500 million years gives no support to the notion of instantaneously created species that thereafter remain largely unchanged. If this record does reflect the exertions of an intelligent designer, he was apparently dissatisfied with nearly all of his creations, repeatedly destroying them and creating a new set of species that just happened to resemble descendants of those that he had destroyed.</p>\n<p>Pandas also makes much of the supposed absence of transitional forms: the &quot;missing&quot; links between major forms of life that, according to evolutionary theory, must have existed as common ancestors. Their absence, claim creationists, is a major embarrassment for evolutionary biology. Phillip Johnson's influential book Darwin on Trial, which appeared in 1993, particularly emphasizes these gaps, which, IDers believe, reflect the designer's creation of major forms ex nihilo. And there are indeed some animals, such as bats, that appear in the fossil record suddenly, without obvious ancestors. Yet in most cases these gaps are certainly due to the imperfection of the fossil record. (Most organisms do not get buried in aquatic sediments, which is a prerequisite for fossilization.) And species that are soft-bodied or have fragile bones, such as bats, degrade before they can fossilize. Paleontologists estimate that we have fossils representing only about one in a thousand of all the species that ever lived.</p>\n<p>In its treatment of evolutionary transitions, Pandas is again guilty of distortion. Paleontologists have uncovered many transitional forms between major groups, almost more than we have a right to expect. Pandas simply ignores &oacute; or waves away &oacute; these &quot;non-missing links,&quot; stating that &quot;we cannot form a smooth, unambiguous transitional series linking, let's say, the first small horse to today's horse, fishes to amphibians, or reptiles to mammals.&quot; This is flatly wrong. All three cited transitions (and others) are well documented with fossils. Moreover, the transitional forms appear at exactly the right time in the fossil record: after the ancestral forms already existed, but before the &quot;linked&quot; later group had evolved.</p>\n<p>Take one example: the link between early reptiles and later mammals, the so-called mammal-like reptiles. Three hundred fifty million years ago, the world was full of reptiles, but there were no mammals. By 250 million years ago, mammals had appeared on the scene. (Fossil reptiles are easily distinguished from fossil mammals by a complex of skeletal traits including features of the teeth and skull.) Around 275 million years ago, forms appear that are intermediate in skeletal traits between reptiles and mammals, in some cases so intermediate that the animals cannot be unambiguously classified as either reptiles or mammals. These mammal-like reptiles, which become less reptilian and more mammalian with time, are the no-longer-missing links between the two forms, important not only because they have the traits of both forms, but also because they occur at exactly the right time.</p>\n<p>One of these traits is worth examining in detail because it is among the finest examples of an evolutionary transition. This trait is the &quot;chewing&quot; hinge where the jaw meets the skull. In early reptiles (and their modern reptilian descendants), the lower jaw comprises several bones, and the hinge is formed by the quadrate bone of the skull and the articular bone of the jaw. As mammal-like reptiles become more mammalian, these hinge bones become smaller, and ultimately the jaw hinge shifts to a different pair of bones: the dentary (our &quot;jawbone&quot;) and the squamosal, another bone of the skull. (The quadrate and articular, much reduced, moved into the middle ear of mammals, forming two of the bones that transmit sounds from the eardrum to the middle ear.) The dentary-squamosal articulation occurs in all modern mammals, the quadrate-articular in modern reptiles; and this difference is often used as the defining feature of these groups.</p>\n<p>Like earlier creationist tracts, Pandas simply denies that this evolution of the jaw hinge occurred. It asserts that &quot;there is no fossil record of such an amazing process,&quot; and further notes that such a migration would be &quot;extraordinary.&quot; This echoes the old creationist argument that an adaptive transition from one type of hinge to another by means of natural selection would be impossible: members of a species could not eat during the evolutionary period when their jaws were being unhinged and then rehinged. (The implication is that the intelligent designer must have done this job instantaneously and miraculously.) But we have long known how this transition happened. It was easily accomplished by natural selection. In 1958, Alfred Crompton described the critical fossil: the mammal-like reptile Diarthrognathus broomi. D. broomi has, in fact, a double jaw joint with two hinges &oacute; the reptilian one and the mammalian one! Obviously, this animal could chew. What better &quot;missing link&quot; could we find?</p>\n<p>It should embarrass IDers that so many of the missing links cited by Pandasas evidence for supernatural intervention are no longer missing. Creationists make a serious mistake when using the absence of transitional forms as evidence for an intelligent designer. In the last decade, paleontologists have uncovered a fairly complete evolutionary series of whales, beginning with fully terrestrial animals that became more and more aquatic over time, with their front limbs evolving into flippers and their hind limbs and pelvis gradually reduced to tiny vestiges. When such fossils are found, as they often are, creationists must then punt and change their emphasis to other missing links, continually retreating before the advance of science.</p>\n<p>As for other transitional forms, IDers simply dismiss them as aberrant fossils.Pandas characterizes Homo erectus and other probable human ancestors as &quot;little more than apes.&quot; But this is false. While H. erectus has a skull with large brow ridges and a braincase much smaller than ours, the rest of its skeleton is nearly identical to that of modern humans.The famous fossilArchaeopteryx, a small dinosaur-like creature with teeth and a basically reptilian skeleton but also with wings and feathers, is probably on or closely related to the line of dinosaurs that evolved into birds. But Pandas dismisses this fossil as just an &quot;odd-ball&quot; type, and laments instead the lack of the unfossilizable: &quot;If only we could find a fossil showing scales developing the properties of feathers, or lungs that were intermediate between the very different reptilian and avian lungs, then we would have more to go on.&quot; It is again a typical creationist strategy that when skeletons of missing links turn up, creationists ignore them and insist that evidence of intermediacy be sought instead in the soft parts that rarely fossilize. In sum, the treatment of the fossil evidence for evolution in Pandas is shoddy and deceptive, and offers no advance over the discredited arguments of scientific creationism.</p>\n<p>In contrast to its long treatment and dismissal of the fossil record, Pandasbarely deals with evidence for evolution from development and vestigial traits. The best it can do is note that vestigial features can have a function, and therefore are not really vestigial. The vestigial pelvic bones and legs of the transitional whale Basilosaurus, which were not connected to the skeleton, may have functioned as a guide for the penis during mating. Such a use, according to the authors of Pandas , means that the legs and pelvis &quot;were not vestigial as originally thought.&quot; But this argument is wrong: no evolutionist denies that the remnants of ancestral traits can retain some functionality or be co-opted for other uses. The &quot;penis guide&quot; has every bone in the mammalian pelvis and rear leg in reduced form &oacute; femur, tibia, fibula, and digits. In Basilosaurus, nearly all of these structures lay within the body wall, and most parts were immobile. Apparently the intelligent designer had a whimsical streak, choosing to construct a sex aid that looked exactly like a degenerate pelvis and set of hind limbs.</p>\n<p>And what about the strong evidence for evolution from biogeography? About this Pandas , like all creationist books, says nothing. The omission is strategic. It would be very hard for IDers to give plausible reasons why an &quot;intelligent&quot; designer stocked oceanic islands with only a few types of animals and plants &oacute; and just those types with the ability to disperse from the nearest mainland. Biogeography has always been the Achilles' heel of creationists, so they just ignore it.</p>\n<p>IV.</p>\n<p>Although intelligent design rejects much of the evidence for evolution, it still admits that some evolutionary change occurs through natural selection. This change is what Pandas calls &quot;microevolution,&quot; or &quot;small scale genetic changes, observable in organisms.&quot; Such microevolutionary changes include the evolution of <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> in <mark>bacteria</mark>, changes in the proportion of different-colored moths due to predation by birds, and all changes wrought by artificial selection. But Pandas hastens to add that microevolution gives no evidence for the origin of diverse types of organisms, because &quot;these limited changes do not accumulate the way Darwinian evolutionary theory requires in order to produce macro changes. The process that produces macroevolutionary changes [defined here as &quot;large scale changes, leading to new levels of complexity&quot;] must be different from any that geneticists have studied so far.&quot;</p>\n<p>So, though one can use selection to transform a wolf into either a Chihuahua or a St. Bernard, that is merely microevolution: they are all still dogs. And a DDT-resistant fly is still a fly. Pandas thus echoes the ID assertion that natural selection cannot do more than create microevolutionary changes: &quot;It cannot produce new characteristics. It only acts on traits that already exist.&quot; But this is specious reasoning. As we have noted, fossils already show that &quot;macro change,&quot; as defined by Pandas , has occurred in the fossil record (the evolution of fish into amphibians, and so on). And if breeders have not turned a dog into another kind of animal, it is because dog breeding has been going on for only a few thousand years, while the differences between dogs and cats, for example, have evolved over more than ten million years. No principle of evolution dictates that evolutionary changes observed during a human lifetime cannot be extrapolated to much longer periods.</p>\n<p>In fact, Pandas admits that the fruit flies of Hawaii &oacute; a diverse group of more than 300 species &oacute; have all evolved from a common ancestor. We now know that this common ancestor lived about 20 million years ago. The species of Hawaiian flies differ in many traits, including size, shape, ecology, color pattern, mating behavior, and so on. One can in fact make a good case that some of the fly species differ more from each other than humans differ from chimps. Why, then, do IDers assert that chimps and humans (whose ancestor lived only 5 million years ago) must have resulted from separate acts of creation by the intelligent designer, while admitting that fruit flies evolved from a common ancestor that lived 20 million years ago? The answer is that humans must at all costs not be lumped in with other species, so as to protect the biblical status of humans as uniquely created in God's image.</p>\n<p>According to Pandas, the theory of &quot;limits to evolution&quot; is a scientific one: &quot;The idea of intelligent design does not preclude the possibility that variation within species occurs, or that new species are formed from existing populations . . . the theory of intelligent design does suggest that there are limits to the amount of variation that natural selection and random change mechanisms can produce.&quot; But there is nothing in the theory of intelligent design that tells us how far evolution can go. This &quot;thus far and no further&quot; view of evolution comes not from any scientific findings of ID; it comes from ID's ancestor, scientific creationism. Scientific Creationism notes that &quot;the creation model . . . recognizes only the kind as the basic created unit, in this case, mankind,&quot; and a chart contrasting evolution with the &quot;creation model&quot; says that the former predicts &quot;new kinds appearing,&quot; while the latter says &quot;no new kinds appearing.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what is a &quot;kind&quot;? No creationist has ever defined it, though they are all very sure that humans and apes are different &quot;kinds.&quot; In fact, the notion that evolution and creation have operated together, with the latter creating distinct &quot;kinds,&quot; was nicely rebutted by Darwin in On the Origin of Species:</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Several eminent naturalists . . . admit that they [evolved species] have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as egg or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb? Although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence.</p>\n<p>In fact, the biblical appendix of Scientific Creationism shows that the term &quot;kind&quot; derives from the biblical notion of created kinds:</p>\n<p>The Scriptures are very clear in their teaching that God created all things as He wanted them to be, each with its own particular structure, according to His own sovereign purposes. The account of Genesis 1, for example, indicates that at least ten major categories of organic life were specially created &quot;after his kind.&quot; . . . Finally, man &quot;kind&quot; was created as another completely separate category. The phrase &quot;after his kind&quot; occurs ten times in this first chapter of Genesis.</p>\n<p>There is thus a clear line of descent from the story of Genesis to the ID notion of evolutionary limits, a line charted by what Darwin called &quot;the blindness of preconceived opinion.&quot; Until IDers tell us what the limits to evolution are, how they can be ascertained, and what evidence supports these limits, this notion cannot be regarded as a genuinely scientific claim.</p>\n<p>IDers make one claim that they tout as truly novel, a claim that has become quite popular. It is the idea that organisms show some adaptations that could not be built by natural selection, thus implying the need for a supernatural creative force such as an intelligent designer. These adaptations share a property called &quot;irreducible complexity,&quot; a characteristic discussed in Pandas but defined more explicitly by Michael Behe in 1996 in his book Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution: &quot;Byirreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.&quot;</p>\n<p>Many man-made objects show this property: Behe cites the mousetrap, which would not work if even one part were removed, such as the catch, the spring, the base, and so on. Pandas mentions a car engine, which will not work if one removes the fan belt, spark plugs, distributor cap, or any of numerous individual parts. A famous example of an irreducibly complex system in the biological realm is the &quot;camera&quot; eye of humans and other vertebrates. The eye has many parts whose individual removal would render the organ useless, including the lens, retina, and optic nerve.</p>\n<p>The reason IDers love &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; features of organisms is that natural selection is powerless (or so they claim) to create such features. As Behe notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly ... by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.... Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>&quot;One fell swoop,&quot; of course, implies that the feature must have been produced by the miraculous intervention of the intelligent designer.</p>\n<p>But this argument for intelligent design has a fatal flaw. We have realized for decades that natural selection can indeed produce systems that, over time, become integrated to the point where they appear to be irreducibly complex. But these features do not evolve by the sequential addition of parts to a feature that becomes functional only at the end. They evolve by adding, via natural selection, more and more parts into an originally rudimentary but functional system, with these parts sometimes co-opted from other structures. Every step of this process improves the organism's survival, and so is evolutionarily possible via natural selection.</p>\n<p>Consider the eye. Creationists have long maintained that it could not have resulted from natural selection, citing a sentence from On the Origin of Species: &quot;To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.&quot; But in the next passage, invariably omitted by creationists, Darwin ingeniously answers his own objection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Thus our eyes did not suddenly appear as full-fledged camera eyes, but evolved from simpler eyes, having fewer components, in ancestral species. Darwin brilliantly addressed this argument by surveying existing species to see if one could find functional but less complex eyes that not only were useful, but also could be strung together into a hypothetical sequence showing how a camera eye might evolve. If this could be done &oacute; and it can &oacute; then the argument for irreducible complexity vanishes, for the eyes of existing species are obviously useful, and each step in the hypothetical sequence could thus evolve by natural selection.</p>\n<p>A possible sequence of such changes begins with pigmented eye spots (as seen in flatworms), followed by an invagination of the skin to form a cup protecting the eyespot and allowing it to better localize the image (as in limpets), followed by a further narrowing of the cup's opening to produce an improved image (the nautilus), followed by the evolution of a protective transparent cover to protect the opening (ragworms), followed by coagulation of part of the fluid in the eyeball into a lens to help focus the light (abalones), followed by the co-opting of nearby muscles to move the lens and vary the focus (mammals). The evolution of a retina, an optic nerve, and so on would follow by natural selection. Each step of this transitional &quot;series&quot; confers increased adaptation on its possessor, because it enables the animal to gather more light or to form better images, both of which aid survival. And each step of this process is exemplified by the eye of a different living species. At the end of the sequence we have the camera eye, which seems irreducibly complex. But the complexity is reducible to a series of small, adaptive steps.</p>\n<p>Now, we do not know the precise order in which the components of the camera eye evolved &oacute; but the point is that the appearance of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; cannot be an argument against neo-Darwinism if we can document a plausible sequence in which the complexity can arise from a series of adaptive steps. The &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; argument is not, in fact, completely novel. It descends, with modification, from the British theologian William Paley, who in 1802 raised the famous &quot;argument from design&quot; in his book Natural Theology. Paley argued that just as finding a watch on the ground implies a conscious designer (the watchmaker), so finding an equally complex organism implies a cosmic designer (God).</p>\n<p>But the eye is not a watch. The human eye, though eminently functional, is imperfect &oacute; certainly not the sort of eye an engineer would create from scratch. Its imperfection arises precisely because our eye evolved using whatever components were at hand, or produced by mutation. Since our retina evolved from an everted part of the brain, for example, the nerves and blood vessels that attach to our photoreceptor cells are on the inside rather than the outside of the eye, running over the surface of the retina. Leakage of these blood vessels can occlude vision, a problem that would not occur if the vessels fed the retina from behind. Likewise, to get the nerve impulses from the photocells to the brain, the different nerves must join together and dive back through the eye, forming the optic nerve. This hole in the retina creates a blind spot in the eye, a flaw that again would be avoidable with a priori design. The whole system is like a car in which all the wires to the dashboard hang inside the driver's compartment instead of being tucked safely out of sight. Evolution differs from a priori design because it is constrained to operate by modifying whatever features have evolved previously. Thus evolution yields fitter types that often have flaws. These flaws violate reasonable principles of intelligent design.</p>\n<p>IDers tend to concentrate more on biochemistry than on organs such as the eye, citing &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; molecular systems such as the mechanism for blood-clotting and the immune system. Like the eye, these systems supposedly could not have evolved, since removal of any step in these pathways would render the entire pathway non-functional. (This biochemical complexity is the subject of Behe's book Darwin's Black Box.) Discussing the blood-clotting system in its sixth chapter (partially written by Behe), Pandasasserts that &quot;like a car engine, biological systems can only work after they have been assembled by someone who knows what the final result will be.&quot; This is nonsense. As we have seen in the case of the eye, biological systems are not useful only at the end of a long evolutionary process, but during every step of that process. And biochemical systems &oacute; like all adaptations created by natural selection &oacute; are not assembled with foresight. Whatever useful mutations happen to arise get folded into the system.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that many biochemical systems are dauntingly complex. A diagram of the blood-clotting pathway looks like a complicated circuit board, with dozens of proteins interacting with one another to one end: healing a wound. And the system seems irreducibly complex, because without any of several key proteins, the blood would not clot. Yet such biochemical systems evolved in the same way that the eye evolved, by adding parts successively and adaptively to simpler, functioning systems. It is more difficult to trace the evolution of biochemical pathways than of anatomical structures because the ancestral metabolic pathways are no longer present. But biologists are beginning to provide plausible scenarios for how &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; biochemical pathways might have evolved. As expected, these systems involve using bits co-opted from other pathways originally having different functions. (Thus, one of the enzymes in the blood-clotting system also plays a role in digestion and cell division.) In view of our progress in understanding biochemical evolution, it is simply irrational to say that because we do not completely understand how biochemical pathways evolved, we should give up trying and invoke the intelligent designer. If the history of science shows us anything, it is that we get nowhere by labeling our ignorance &quot;God.&quot;</p>\n<p>Insofar as intelligent-design theory can be tested scientifically, it has been falsified. Organisms simply do not look as if they had been intelligently designed. Would an intelligent designer create millions of species and then make them go extinct, only to replace them with other species, repeating this process over and over again? Would an intelligent designer produce animals having a mixture of mammalian and reptilian traits, at exactly the time when reptiles are thought to have been evolving into mammals? Why did the designer give tiny, non-functional wings to kiwi birds? Or useless eyes to cave animals? Or a transitory coat of hair to a human fetus? Or an appendix, an injurious organ that just happens to resemble a vestigial version of a digestive pouch in related organisms? Why would the designer give us a pathway for making vitamin C, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes? Why didn't the intelligent designer stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species? And why would he make the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different? Why, about a million years ago, would the designer produce creatures that have an apelike cranium perched atop a humanlike skeleton? And why would he then successively replace these creatures with others having an ever-closer resemblance to modern humans?</p>\n<p>There are only two answers to these questions: either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved. Few people, religious or otherwise, will find the second alternative palatable. It is the modern version of the old argument that God put fossils in the rocks to test our faith.</p>\n<p>The final blow to the claim that intelligent design is scientific is its proponents' admission that we cannot understand the designer's goals or methods. Behe owns up to this in Darwin's Black Box: &quot;Features that strike us as odd in a design might have been placed there by the designer for a reason &oacute; for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yetundetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason &oacute; or they might not.&quot; And, discussing skeletal differences between placental and marsupial mammals, Pandas notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why were not the North American placentals given the same bones? Would an intelligent designer withhold these structures from placentals if they were superior to the placental system? At present we do not know; however, we all recognize that an engineer can choose any of several different engineering solutions to overcome a single design problem. An intelligent designer might reasonably be expected to use a variety (if a limited variety) of design approaches to produce a single engineering solution, also. Even if it is assumed that an intelligent designer did indeed have a good reason for every decision that was made, and for including every trait in each organism, it does not follow that such reasons will be obvious to us.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Well, if we admit that the designer had a number of means and motives, which can be self-contradictory, arbitrary, improvisatory, and &quot;unguessable,&quot; then we are left with a theory that cannot be rejected. Every conceivable observation of nature, including those that support evolution, becomes compatible with ID, for the ways of the designer are unfathomable. And a theory that cannot be rejected is not a scientific theory. If IDers want to have a genuinely scientific theory, let them propose a model that can be rigorously tested.</p>\n<p>Given its lack of rigor, one might expect that ID theory would not inspire much scientific research. And there is virtually none. Despite the claims of ID to be a program of research, its adherents have published only one refereed paper supporting ID in a scientific journal: a review of ID by Stephen C. Meyer, the director of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, which appeared in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. This paper merely rehashes ID arguments for why natural selection and evolution cannot explain the diversity of life and then asserts that intelligent design is the only alternative. It distorts the evolutionary literature it purports to review, and it neither advances new scientific arguments nor suggests any way that ID better explains patterns in nature. Not surprisingly, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington later disowned the paper because it did &quot;not meet the scientific standards of the Proceedings.&quot;</p>\n<p>The gold standard for modern scientific achievement is the publication of new results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. By that standard, IDers have failed miserably. As William Dembski himself noted, &quot;There are good and bad reasons to be skeptical of intelligent design. Perhaps the best reason is that intelligent design has yet to establish itself as a thriving scientific research program.&quot; IDers desperately crave scientific respectability, but it is their own theory that prevents them from attaining it. Thus, while IDers demand that evolutionists produce thousands of transitional fossils and hundreds of detailed scenarios about the evolution of biochemical pathways, they put forth no observations supporting the plausibility of a supernatural designer, nor do they show how appeal to such a designer could explain the fossil record, embryology, and biogeography better than neo-Darwinism. Herbert Spencer could have been describing ID when he declared that &quot;those who cavalierly reject the Theory of Evolution as not being adequately supported by facts, seem to forget that their own theory is supported by no facts at all. Like the majority of men who are born to a given belief, they demand the most rigorous proof of any adverse belief, but assume that their own needs none.&quot;</p>\n<p>Finally, the reliance of ID on supernatural intervention means that the enterprise cannot be seen, strictly speaking, as scientific. In his rejection of scientific creationism in McLean v. Arkansas, Judge Overton described the characteristics of good science:</p>\n<blockquote><p>(1) It is guided by natural law;</p> <p>(2) It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;</p> <p>(3) It is testable against the empirical world;</p> <p>(4) Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and</p> <p>(5) It is falsifiable.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>By invoking the repeated occurrence of supernatural intervention by an intelligent designer to create new species and new traits, ID violates criteria 1 and 2; and in its ultimate reliance on Christian dogma and God, it violates criteria 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p>In candid moments, usually when writing for or speaking to a religious audience, IDers admit the existence not only of supernatural acts as a part of their theory, but also of Christian supernatural acts. In a foreword to a book on creationism, Johnson wrote: &quot;The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that 'In the beginning was the Word,' and 'In the beginning God created.' Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message.&quot; And here is Dembski writing in Touchstone, a Christian magazine: &quot;The world is a mirror representing the divine life.... Intelligent design readily embraces the sacramental nature of physical reality. Indeed intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory.&quot; Indeed, in the manuscript draft of the first edition of Pandas , the terms &quot;creationism,&quot; &quot;creationist,&quot; and &quot;creation&quot; are used repeatedly instead of the equivalent ID terms, and &quot;creationism&quot; is defined identically to &quot;intelligent design&quot; in the published version. Nothing gives a clearer indication that one ancestor of this textbook was the Bible.</p>\n<p>It is clear, then, that intelligent design did not arise because of some long-standing problems with evolutionary theory, or because new facts have called neoDarwinism into question. ID is here for only one reason &oacute; to act as a Trojan horse poised before the public schools: a seemingly secular vessel ready to inject its religious message into the science curriculum. The contents of Pandas , and of the other writings of IDers, are simply a cunning pedagogical ploy to circumvent legal restrictions against religious creationism. (With any luck, though, the publicity will backfire. Last monthThe York Dispatch in Pennsylvania reported that the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, the group that publishes this textbook and others designed to present &quot;a Christian perspective,&quot; wanted to intervene in the Dover lawsuit. According to John Buell, the foundation's president, the association of ID with creationism &quot;would make the book radioactive,&quot; and his outfit could lose as much as $525,000 in sales.)</p>\n<p>ID is part of what Johnson candidly calls the &quot;wedge strategy,&quot; a carefully crafted scheme that begins with the adoption of intelligent design as an alternative theory to evolution, after which ID will edge out evolution until it is the only view left, after which it will become full-blown biblical creationism. The ultimate goal is to replace naturalist science with spiritualist thinking, and the method is to hammer the wedge of ID into science at its most vulnerable point: public education. In Johnson's own words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So the question is: &quot;How to win?&quot; That's when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the &quot;wedge&quot; strategy: &quot;stick with the most important thing,&quot; the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, &quot;Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?&quot; and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Johnson was even more explicit in 1999 in remarks to a conference on &quot;Reclaiming America for Christ.&quot; Rob Boston reported Johnson's remarks inChurch &amp; State magazine:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Johnson calls his movement &quot;The Wedge.&quot; The objective, he said, is to convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus shifting the debate from creationism v. evolution to the existence of God v. the nonexistence of God. From there people are introduced to &quot;the truth&quot; of the Bible and then &quot;the question of sin&quot; and finally &quot;introduced to Jesus.&quot;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Other major figures in the ID movement have been equally clear about their religious motivations. Here is Dembski:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But there are deeper motivations. I think at a fundamental level, in terms of what drives me in this is that I think God's glory is being robbed by these naturalistic approaches to biological evolution, creation, the origin of the world, the origin of biological complexity and diversity. When you are attributing the wonders of nature to these mindless material mechanisms, God's glory is getting robbed.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Father's [Reverend Moon's] words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism, just as many of my fellow Unificationists had already devoted their lives to destroying Marxism. When Father chose me (along with about a dozen other seminary graduates) to enter a Ph.D. program in 1978, I welcomed the opportunity to prepare myself for battle.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Do these people really believe in intelligent design? There is no reason to think otherwise. They are not lying for their cause, but sincerely hold that life on earth reflects a succession of miracles worked by a supernatural agent. In fact, they view evolutionists as the duplicitous ones. In an interview in The Sacramento Bee in 1991, Johnson proclaimed that &quot;scientists have long known that Darwinism is false. They have adhered to the myth out of self-interest and a zealous desire to put down God.&quot; Never mind that many scientists, including evolutionists, are religious.</p>\n<p>Given the overwhelming evidence for evolution and the lack of evidence for ID, how can intelligent people hold such views? Is their faith so strong that it blinds them to all evidence? It is a bit more complicated than that. After all, many theologians and religious people accept evolution. The real issues behind intelligent design &oacute; and much of creationism &oacute; are purpose and morality: specifically, the fear that if evolution is true, then we are no different from other animals, not the special objects of God's creation but a contingent product of natural selection, and so we lack real purpose, and our morality is just the law of the jungle. Tom DeLay furnished a colorful example of this view on the floor of the House of Representatives on June 16, 1999. Explaining the causes of the massacre at Columbine High School, he read a sarcastic letter in a Texas newspaper that suggested that &quot;it couldn't have been because our school systems teach the children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud.&quot;</p>\n<p>The notion that naturalism and materialism are the enemies of morality and a sense of human purpose, and that religion is their only ally, is pervasive in the writings of IDers. As Johnson noted, &quot;Once God is culturally determined to be imaginary, then God's morality loses its foundation and withers away.&quot; Nancy Pearcey, a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, summarizes why evolution disturbs so many Americans:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why does the public care so passionately about a theory of biology? Because people sense intuitively that there's much more at stake than a scientific theory. They know that when naturalistic evolution is taught in the science classroom, then a naturalistic view of ethics will be taught down the hallway in the history classroom, the sociology classroom, the family life classroom, and in all areas of the curriculum.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Even some parents in Dover, though opposed to teaching ID in school, worry that learning evolution will erode the Christian values that they are trying to instill in their children.</p>\n<p>But the acceptance of evolution need not efface morality or purpose. Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life's diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life. Philosophers have argued for years about whether ethics should have a basis in nature. There is certainly no logical connection between evolution and immorality. Nor is there a causal connection: in Europe, religion is far less pervasive than in America, and belief in evolution is more widespread, but somehow the continent remains civilized. Most religious scientists, laymen, and theologians have not found the acceptance of evolution to impede living an upright, meaningful life. And the idea that religion provides the sole foundation for meaning and morality also cannot be right: the world is full of skeptics, agnostics, and atheists who live good and meaningful lives.</p>\n<p>Barring a miracle, the Dover Area School District will lose its case. Anyone who bothers to study ID and its evolution from earlier and more overtly religious forms of creationism will find it an unscientific, faith-based theory ultimately resting on the doctrines of fundamentalist Christianity. Its presentation in schools thus violates both the Constitution and the principles of good education. There is no secular reason why evolutionary biology, among all the sciences, should be singled out for a school-mandated disclaimer. But the real losers will be the people of Dover, who will likely be saddled with huge legal bills and either a substantial cut in the school budget or a substantial hike in property taxes. We can also expect that, if they lose, the IDers will re-group and return in a new disguise even less obviously religious. I await the formation of the Right to Teach Problems with Evolution Movement.</p>\n<p>IDers have been helped by Americans' continuing doubts about the truth of evolution. According to a Gallup poll taken last year, 45 percent of Americans agree with the statement, &quot;God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years.&quot; Asked if evolution is well supported by evidence, 35 percent of Americans said yes, 35 percent said no, and 29 percent said they lack the knowledge to reply. As a rationalist, I cannot help but believe that the first group would swell were Americans to be thoroughly taught the evidence for evolution, which is rarely done in public high schools. I have seen creationist students become evolutionists when they learn about biogeography or examine the skulls of mammal-like reptiles. What we need in the schools is not less teaching of evolution but more.</p>\n<p>In the end, many Americans may still reject evolution, finding the creationist alternative psychologically more comfortable. But emotion should be distinguished from thought, and a &quot;comfort level&quot; should not affect what is taught in the science classroom. As Judge Overton wrote in his magisterial decision striking down Arkansas Act 590, which mandated equal classroom time for &quot;scientific creationism&quot;:</p>",

It plays out in your gut, in soil, in every pond and puddle. And now, thanks to experiments aboard the International Space Station, scientists know it plays out differently when gravity disappears.</p>\n<p>A study published in PLOS Biology sent the bacteriophage T7 and its favorite target, Escherichia coli, into orbit to watch what happens when the rules change. Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are viruses that infect and kill <mark>bacteria</mark>. On Earth, phage and host wage a relentless arms race: <mark>bacteria</mark> evolve defenses, phages evolve countermeasures, and the cycle repeats at furious speed. T7 can infect and destroy E. coli in under 30 minutes under normal conditions. But in microgravity, the researchers found, that timeline stretches dramatically.</p>\n<p>The reason is surprisingly physical. Without gravity, there&rsquo;s no convection, no settling, no gentle stirring of particles through fluid. Phages and <mark>bacteria</mark> meet each other only through slow, restricted diffusion. In Earth-based controls, viral numbers exploded between two and four hours. In the space samples, nothing happened at those early time points. Yet by 23 days, the phages had succeeded. Microgravity slowed the attack but did not stop it.</p>\n<h3>Different pressures, different mutations</h3>\n<p>What made the study genuinely surprising came from sequencing the survivors. After more than three weeks, both phages and <mark>bacteria</mark> had accumulated new mutations, and those mutations looked nothing like what appeared in the Earth controls. The space-faring phages developed changes in tail proteins that help them latch onto <mark>bacteria</mark>l surfaces. The <mark>bacteria</mark>, meanwhile, evolved alterations in genes tied to their outer membranes and stress responses, the classic defensive playbook of a cell trying to keep viruses out.</p>\n<p>The researchers then did something clever. They used a technique called deep mutational scanning to test 1,660 variants of the phage&rsquo;s receptor binding protein, the molecular tool it uses to grab onto <mark>bacteria</mark>. The variants that thrived in microgravity looked completely different from those that thrived on Earth. Whatever selective pressure microgravity exerts, it rewards a different set of genetic solutions.</p>\n<h3>Turning space lessons into medicine</h3>\n<p>Here is where the study shifts from curiosity to potential clinical value. The team took the mutations that succeeded in space and built new phage variants from them. They then tested these &ldquo;microgravity-informed&rdquo; phages against two strains of uropathogenic E. coli, the kind that cause stubborn urinary tract <mark>infection</mark>s and resist the original T7. The space-derived variants worked. They infected and killed <mark>bacteria</mark> that shrugged off the wild-type virus.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Microgravity selections revealed novel genetic determinants of fitness and enabled efficient navigation of sequence space to find improved phage variants.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The researchers are careful not to oversell. ISS experiments come with unavoidable limitations: freeze-thaw cycles, processing delays, fewer time points than anyone would like. And they disclose that some authors hold equity in a phage therapeutics company, a reminder that the path from orbit to pharmacy involves commercial interests.</p>\n<p>Still, the broader point stands. <mark>Phage therapy</mark>, the use of viruses to kill <mark>drug-resistant</mark> <mark>bacteria</mark>, has been hampered by the difficulty of engineering phages that can hit new targets. This study suggests that microgravity acts like a different laboratory, one that exposes mutational possibilities hidden under Earth&rsquo;s constant pull. For anyone worried about <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, that is a useful trick to have.</p>\n<p>There is also a quieter lesson for long-duration spaceflight. Microbial communities aboard spacecraft are not simply Earth microbes in a new zip code. When the physics of mixing and transport change, the evolutionary pressures change too. Phage and <mark>bacteria</mark> can drift onto trajectories no ground experiment would predict. For astronauts spending months or years in orbit or beyond, understanding those shifts matters. The microscopic arms race continues in space. It just follows different rules.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003568\">PLOS Biology, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3003568</a></p>\n<p><strong>There's no paywall here</strong></p>\n<p><em>If our reporting has informed or inspired you, please consider making a donation.

Despite their household names, their microbiomes remain under-researched.</p>\n<p>&quot;Understanding marsupial gut microbiomes advances our knowledge of host-microbiome evolution, helps explain adaptations to challenging diets like eucalyptus, and supports conservation efforts for threatened species through improved health management,&quot; says Kate Bowerman, a microbiologist at the University of Queensland (UQ) and co-author of the study.</p>\n<p>This is what prompted UQ researchers to work towards deepening our understanding of the makeup of <mark>bacteria</mark> and viruses that live inside their guts.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with scientists from Denmark and the US, the team collected and analysed faecal samples from 82 captive marsupials living in wildlife sanctuaries, and 16 wild marsupials in forested areas around Queensland.</p>\n<p>This research provided the first metagenomic data for 13 of the 23 marsupial species studied, including the red kangaroo and the common brushtail possum. They revealed that host family, animal location, and diet all contributed towards variance between different microbiomes.</p>\n<p>One possible shared adaptation the researchers looked for was between animals that feed on eucalyptus, either exclusively (koalas and southern greater gliders) or generally (common and golden brushtail and common ringtail possums). Predictably, these two groups showed significant differences in the abundance of certain microbes. However, even between the two specialist eucalypt feeders, koalas and greater gliders, each species showed distinct adaptation to this challenging diet with microbiomes that reflected the digestion of the different eucalypt type each prefers to eat.</p>\n<p>More concerningly, researchers identified an increased prevalence of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> genes in the microbiome of some captive marsupials compared to their wild counterparts. This is likely driven by human intervention via antibiotic treatments to <mark>infection</mark>s at wildlife sanctuaries.</p>\n<p>These comparative insights between wild and captive animals &quot;will help veterinarians select more effective treatments and develop better antibiotic stewardship protocols for captive marsupial management,&quot; says Bowerman.</p>\n<p>She continues that work is still needed to further understand of what role these microbes play in the hosts' ecosystems. The next steps will be to isolate and characterise the key species found in marsupial microbiomes in order to study their functional roles, for example, in how they contribute to eucalyptus digestion or host health.</p>\n<p>About the Microbiology Society</p>\n<p>/Public Release.

From nonstick cookware and flame-retardant furniture to pesticide-treated fruits and vegetables, these substances are deeply embedded in modern life.</p>\n<p>Once inside the body, researchers say, many of these compounds interact directly with gut <mark>bacteria</mark>, disrupting microbial balance and potentially encouraging <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>.</p>\n<p>The Cambridge-led team tested 1,076 industrial and agricultural chemicals, including pesticides, plastic additives, flame retardants and chemical breakdown products commonly detected in food and water. These substances were exposed to 22 species of <mark>bacteria</mark> typically found in healthy human guts.</p>\n<p>Rather than studying humans or animals, the researchers grew the <mark>bacteria</mark> in controlled laboratory conditions and observed how well they survived and multiplied when exposed to each chemical. A machine-learning model was then developed to predict which chemicals were most likely to harm gut <mark>bacteria</mark>.</p>\n<p>The results were striking. Out of all the chemicals tested, 168 significantly slowed or completely stopped <mark>bacteria</mark>l growth. Flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), commonly used in electronics and furniture, were found to substantially alter <mark>bacteria</mark>l community structure.</p>\n<p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=\"https://nationaldailyng.com/health-experts-warn-against-misinformation-on-dialysis-emphasise-evidence-based-kidney-care/\">Health experts warn against misinformation on dialysis, emphasise evidence-based kidney care</a></strong></p>\n<p>Several compounds&mdash;including closantel, an antiparasitic drug used in livestock; bisphenol AF, a plastic additive; and emamectin benzoate, an insecticide ingredient&mdash;caused broad-spectrum suppression, affecting multiple <mark>bacteria</mark>l species at once.</p>\n<p>In total, the researchers identified 588 harmful chemical-<mark>bacteria</mark> interactions, most of which were previously unknown. Notably, some of the most affected microbes were &ldquo;keystone&rdquo; species responsible for regulating inflammation and producing short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which nourish the cells lining the colon.</p>\n<p>Indra Roux, Ph.D., of the University of Cambridge&rsquo;s MRC Toxicology Unit and the study&rsquo;s first author, said the findings were unexpected.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found that many chemicals designed to act only on one type of target, say insects or fungi, also affect gut <mark>bacteria</mark>,&rdquo; Roux said. &ldquo;We were surprised that some of these chemicals had such strong effects. Many industrial chemicals like flame retardants and plasticizers&mdash;regularly encountered in daily life&mdash;weren&rsquo;t thought to affect living organisms at all, but they do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning findings involved <mark>bacteria</mark>l defence mechanisms. The study showed that some gut <mark>bacteria</mark> exposed to industrial chemicals activated efflux pumps&mdash;protein systems that expel toxic substances from cells. These same systems are commonly used by <mark>bacteria</mark> to resist antibiotics.</p>\n<p>In several cases, <mark>bacteria</mark> that developed resistance to industrial chemicals also became more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Researchers warn this suggests environmental pollution may be indirectly contributing to the global <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> crisis by &ldquo;training&rdquo; <mark>bacteria</mark> to survive drug exposure even in the absence of antibiotics.</p>\n<p>The study also found that chemical exposure altered <mark>bacteria</mark>l metabolism. Some microbes survived by shutting down pathways responsible for producing beneficial compounds involved in immune regulation and cardiovascular health. While this helped the <mark>bacteria</mark> endure chemical stress, it reduced their ability to support human health.</p>\n<p>Importantly, even low-level exposure was enough to trigger these changes. Researchers noted that small, routine exposures&mdash;such as pesticide residues on produce or flame-retardant particles in household dust&mdash;may be sufficient to disrupt the gut microbiome over time.</p>\n<p>Scientists say the findings highlight a major blind spot in chemical safety regulation. Most safety assessments focus on whether substances harm humans directly, without considering their impact on the trillions of beneficial microbes living in the body.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The real power of this large-scale study is that we now have the data to predict the effects of new chemicals, with the aim of moving to a future where new chemicals are safe by design,&rdquo; said Kiran Patil, Ph.D., the study&rsquo;s senior author.</p>\n<p>He added that more real-world exposure data will be needed to determine how closely these laboratory findings reflect what happens in the human body.</p>",

But evolving roles must be grounded in clinical need, organisational priorities and demonstrable impact.</strong></p>\n<p>At the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, pharmacists have long practised to an expanded scope. Pharmacy roles include running disease management and anticoagulation services, writing chart corrections in partnership with medical staff and participating in emergency responses such as stroke callouts.</p>\n<p>Behind every expanded role is a clear need, said Professor Michael Dooley MPS, Director of Pharmacy at Alfred Health and Chair of PSA&rsquo;s Hospital Pharmacy Practice Community of Specialty Interest.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;When you start to think about offering new services or evolving roles, you need to ask why,&rsquo; he told attendees at a session on the topic at PSA25 in August. If there isn&rsquo;t a reason beyond &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested&rdquo;, then why are you doing it?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>To expand their services, hospital pharmacy departments must also align with organisational and broader governmental priorities, Prof Dooley said.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;If I want more staff or more support, I need to talk in the language of the organisation and make sure we address issues that are organisational priorities.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>This approach has enabled pharmacists at the Alfred to move beyond dispensary-based roles and embed themselves at key points along the patient journey.</p>\n<p>Around 50&ndash;60% of pharmacists at the Alfred are allocated to a clinical unit and work as part of the medical team, Prof Dooley explained. A further 20% work in operational roles, such as in sterile suites, dispensaries and outpatients, while around 5% focus on medicines use and safety, and others are in education and training.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t centre all our staff in dispensaries,&rsquo; Prof Dooley said. &lsquo;The opportunities for people to practise across a whole range of things are really diverse. That happened because we first identified a clinical need and then investigated whether it was within our scope of practice.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Anything you&rsquo;re considering taking forward, you need to think about it in terms of impact.&rsquo;</p>\n<h3>Training pathways for hospital pharmacists</h3>\n<p>For hospital pharmacists looking to expand their scope, there are now multiple pathways available.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;It used to be said that you had to do your internship at a hospital pharmacy to get in the door,&rsquo; said Lauren Foley, Lead Pharmacist for Learning and Development at Alfred Health. &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s happened over the last 5&ndash;10 years is we now have these diverse entry points. It&rsquo;s about finding the pathway that works for you.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>As well as an internship, pharmacists can undertake foundation residencies, which provide generalist training over a 2-year period.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;At the 3- to 7-year mark, you can start thinking about specialisation or a registrar training program, which develops advanced practice in a particular area or scope,&rsquo; Ms Foley said. &lsquo;There are also external training and credentialing programs.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Ms Foley highlighted the stroke credentialing program at Alfred Health as an example of expanded practice driven by patient need.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;It was identified that patients weren&rsquo;t receiving thrombolysis within the 60-minute timeframe that we know preserves brain function,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;So the question became: how can we improve that outcome?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>One solution was embedding a pharmacist into those stroke teams who see patients in the emergency department. The role of pharmacists was to obtain the best possible medication history, make recommendations around the management of acute blood pressure and facilitate the early administration of thrombolysis.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;the initiative led to an improvement in the number of patients who received thrombolysis within 60 minutes. That&rsquo;s how we know the role is making a difference.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>To prepare pharmacists, credentialing requirements include a minimum level of experience, targeted education, assessment, and an objective structured clinical examination with a neurologist and senior pharmacist.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;We needed to equip pharmacists with the knowledge, the expertise and the confidence to go there and be part of those stroke calls,&rsquo; Ms Foley said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite a confronting scenario so you need pharmacists who can make confident and appropriate recommendations in a life-or-death situation.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Importantly, the impact of the program has been measurable.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;There has been research showing the initiative led to an improvement in the number of patients who received thrombolysis within 60 minutes,&rsquo; Ms Foley said. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how we know the role is making a difference.&rsquo;</p>\n<h3>Beyond the bedside</h3>\n<p>The scope of practice for hospital pharmacists goes further than direct patient care. Pharmacists lead medicines safety initiatives, antimicrobial stewardship programs, and research and education programs.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s also an emerging role in hospital pharmacy departments for stewardship pharmacists, who have a particular role or area of interest, and they become the go-to person for specialised advice, whether it be for anticoagulants [or] antibiotics,&rsquo; Ms Foley said.</p>\n<p>In every role, pharmacists need to work closely with colleagues from other specialties, Prof Dooley said.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;You need multidisciplinary support. You can&rsquo;t do any of these things by yourself. If you&rsquo;re interested in developing your services, you have to do that as part of the team.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>This is one of Ms Foley&rsquo;s favourite parts of the job. &lsquo;There are opportunities to have a chat with the physio or the speech pathologist, to ask the dietitian why they&rsquo;ve recommended a particular type of enteral nutrition, and to be with the doctor on the ward round. It&rsquo;s so important to learn from people who are specialists in their area.&rsquo;</p>\n<p><b><i>Join PSA&rsquo;s </i></b><a href=\"https://www.psa.org.au/networking-events/networking/communities-of-specialty-interest/\"><b><i>Communities of Specialty Interest</i></b></a><b><i> to connect, collaborate and advance your specialty practice.</i></b></p>",

But if it is negative, testing for other <mark>pathogens</mark> follows - and this often leads to delay in diagnosis and delay in correct treatment.&quot;ICMR has flagged that this step-by-step approach not only raises costs, but also risks missing the actual cause, as many <mark>infection</mark>s present with overlapping symptoms. The planned single-test model is intended to screen for priority <mark>pathogens</mark> in one go, allowing clinicians to move faster from suspicion to confirmation.The diagnostic delays have wider clinical consequences. While test results are awaited, doctors often initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. &quot;Empirical antibiotic therapy is started during the provisional diagnosis phase and broadly covers many microorganisms,&quot; Gautam said. &quot;If this continues for long without a positive report, it increases the chances of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark>,&quot; he said.Concerns over this trend are reflected in the ICMR-<mark>Antimicrobial Resistance</mark> Research &amp; Surveillance Network (<mark>AMR</mark>SN) annual report 2024, which shows that several routinely used antibiotics are rapidly losing effectiveness against <mark>bacteria</mark> most frequently isolated from hospitals.Faster, syndrome-based diagnosis could help reverse this pattern by enabling an early shift to targeted therapy, which carries a much lower risk of resistance. ICMR has also linked quicker diagnosis to stronger outbreak surveillance, citing lessons from Covid, when delayed detection allowed early silent transmission.The proposed tests will be tailored to India's disease burden, using national surveillance data. ICMR will support Indian manufacturers and research institutions to develop, validate and scale up these kits, including rapid production during outbreaks and future pandemics.

GARDP will receive rights to manufacture and commercialize the drug in more than 160 countries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The confirmation of this partnership is a powerful indicator of Debio1453&rsquo;s potential to replenish a critically depleted anti<mark>bacteria</mark>l pipeline, addressing a severe therapeutic gap,&rdquo; said Morgane Vanbiervliet, PhD, director of global development and licensing for Debiopharm. &ldquo;For those struggling with <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> gonorrhoea, this agreement signals a decisive step toward restoring effective treatment options and ensuring long-term antibiotic sustainability.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>More antibiotics for gonorrhea needed</h3>\n<p>The collaboration comes <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/fda-approves-2-new-oral-gonorrhea-antibiotics'\">on the heels</a> of the US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of two new antibiotics for gonorrhea, zoliflodacin and gepotidacin&mdash;the first new antibiotics approved for gonorrhea in decades. Zoliflodacin was jointly developed by GARDP and Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics.</p>\n<p>The approvals may prove critical, as <em>N gonorrhoeae</em>, which has developed resistance to all antibiotics used to treat it, is growing increasingly resistant to ceftriaxone, the last remaining recommended treatment. GARDP and Debiopharm say the new partnership will help ensure that the estimated 82 million gonorrhea cases a year globally have effective treatment options.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is great to see a Swiss for-profit and a Swiss non-profit working together to develop an innovative new solution to address gonorrhoea and explore opportunities in other areas,&rdquo; said GARDP executive director Manica Balasegaram, MRCP, MSc.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"rift valley fever\" src=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/ethiopian_shepherd-rod_waddington.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Rod Waddington / Flickr cc</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"pregnant woman \" src=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/doctor-pregnant-woman-large.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Photo/ CDC</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Humphreys County white-tailed deer\" src=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/Humphreys%20County%20deer.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Risto Silaste / Flickr cc</figcaption></figure>",

These mutations changed how the phage infects the <mark>bacteria</mark>.</p>\n<p>&quot;To me one of the most striking findings was not just that mutations appeared across the phage genome, but that microgravity pushed evolution into corners of the phage we still don't fully understand,&quot; Huss said.</p>\n<p>Based on their findings, microgravity may not just change how <em>fast</em> <mark>infection</mark> happens but also which of a virus's genes <em>matter most</em> when it comes to successfully infecting a <mark>bacteria</mark>l host.</p>\n<p>&quot;We're just beginning to scratch the surface,&quot; Dr. Srivatsan Raman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, another lead author on the study, told Space.com. &quot;We just have to do more experiments with more complex conditions.&quot;</p>\n<p>The phages weren't the only ones to change, as the <mark>bacteria</mark> seemed to evolve too. The <em>E. coli</em> exposed to the phages accumulated many more mutations than <mark>bacteria</mark> without phage threats, consistent with selection pressure that drives evolutionary arms races.</p>\n<p>Some of the most notable changes hit genes linked to the outer membranes, potentially altering phage attachment while helping <mark>bacteria</mark> survive stress.</p>\n<p>&quot;Microgravity doesn't just slow things down, it qualitatively reshapes phage&ndash;host coevolution, from <mark>infection</mark> dynamics to the specific genes and mutations that matter,&quot; Huss noted.</p>\n<h2>Microgravity as a way forward for Earth-based medicine?</h2>\n<p>Using a technique called <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-url=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?\" href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?\"><u>deep mutational scanning</u></a>, the team scanned for over 1,600 mutation variants in the phage genome, finding that the &quot;winning&quot; mutations in microgravity differed sharply from those on Earth.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our results support microgravity as a <em>distinct </em>selection environment that reveals different parts of the fitness landscape than we can capture terrestrially,&quot; said Huss.</p>\n<p>The researchers used these mutations to create altered phages which they tested on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-url=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10537683/\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10537683/\"><u>uropathogenic </u><u><em>E. coli</em></u></a> &mdash; strains of <em>E. coli</em> associated with urinary tract <mark>infection</mark>s &mdash; that were more resistant to the T7 phages' attacks.

This is a plausible evolutionary trajectory that future experiments should actively test by monitoring antibiotic susceptibility, stress responses, and competitive interactions over time.&quot;</p>\n<p>Could these adaptations truly be a threat for humans on long-term space missions? Possibly, but for Raman, more testing is needed before that conclusion could be reached.</p>\n<p>&quot;<mark>Pathogens</mark> evolve all the time,&quot; Raman said. &quot;I think we ought to do more studies to see if <mark>bacteria</mark> can evolve towards mutations that might make them more pathogenic under microgravity conditions. Those are not experiments that we've actually done in this study.</p>\n<p>&quot;But <mark>bacteria</mark> are very resilient and they evolve all the time. So I wouldn't rule out the possibility, but again, one has to do these rigorous experiments to ask: can a <mark>bacteria</mark> become a pathogen under ISS conditions?&quot;</p>\n<p>One such area of future space research could be looking at the human microbiome, as it's still not well understood how the microbiome evolves in the conditions of space.</p>\n<p>For humans on Earth, the results of this study are more positive, as microgravity could help scientists to develop phages that can kill off more resistant <mark>bacteria</mark>.</p>\n<p>&quot;The real power of these space-derived fitness landscapes is that they don't stand alone. They can be merged with the rich terrestrial datasets we already have to sharpen engineering strategies for therapeutic use cases. That's arguably the most immediately actionable takeaway,&quot; said Huss.</p>",

Phil Huss of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S.A., and colleagues present these findings January 13<sup>th</sup> in the open-access journal <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>\n<p>Interactions between phages&mdash;viruses that infect <mark>bacteria</mark>&mdash;and their hosts play an integral role in microbial ecosystems. Often described as being in an evolutionary &ldquo;arms race,&rdquo; <mark>bacteria</mark> can evolve defenses against phages, while phages develop new ways to thwart defenses. While virus-<mark>bacteria</mark> interactions have been studied extensively on Earth, microgravity conditions alter <mark>bacteria</mark>l physiology and the physics of virus-<mark>bacteria</mark> collisions, disrupting typical interactions.</p>\n<p>However, few studies have explored the specifics of how phage-<mark>bacteria</mark> dynamics differ in microgravity. To address that gap, Huss and colleagues compared two sets of <mark>bacteria</mark>l <em>E. coli</em> samples infected with a phage known as T7&mdash;one set incubated on Earth and the other aboard the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the space-station samples showed that, after an initial delay, the T7 phage successfully infected the <em>E. coli</em>. However, whole-genome sequencing revealed marked differences in both <mark>bacteria</mark>l and viral genetic mutations between the Earth samples versus the microgravity samples.</p>\n<p>The space-station phages gradually accumulated specific mutations that could boost phage infectivity or their ability to bind receptors on <mark>bacteria</mark>l cells. Meanwhile, the space-station <em>E. coli</em> accumulated mutations that could protect against phages and enhance survival success in near-weightless conditions.</p>\n<p>The researchers then applied a high-throughput technique known as deep mutational scanning to more closely examine changes in the T7 receptor binding protein, which plays a key role in <mark>infection</mark>, revealing further significant differences between microgravity versus Earth conditions. Additional experiments on Earth linked these microgravity-associated changes in the receptor binding protein to increased activity against <em>E. coli</em> strains that cause urinary tract <mark>infection</mark>s in humans and are normally resistant to T7.</p>\n<p>Overall, this study highlights the potential for phage research aboard the ISS to reveal new insights into microbial adaption, with potential relevance to both space exploration and human health.</p>\n<p>The authors add, &ldquo;Space fundamentally changes how phages and <mark>bacteria</mark> interact: <mark>infection</mark> is slowed, and both organisms evolve along a different trajectory than they do on Earth. By studying those space-driven adaptations, we identified new biological insights that allowed us to engineer phages with far superior activity against <mark>drug-resistant</mark> <mark>pathogens</mark> back on Earth.&rdquo;</p>",

These <mark>infection</mark>s, often driven by invasive procedures and increasing <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, impose a substantial burden on healthcare systems globally. For instance, data from public health authorities in developed regions consistently show that up to <b>10%</b> of patients in developing countries and <b>7%</b> in developed countries acquire at least one HAI while hospitalized. This high incidence necessitates the continuous and rigorous purchase of advanced dis<mark>infection</mark> products, sterilization equipment, and protective barriers. The economic cost is also acute, with surgical site <mark>infection</mark>s alone costing healthcare systems billions annually. This constant threat fuels demand for comprehensive <mark>infection</mark> prevention strategies and solutions.</p>\n<ul> <li><b>Increasing Focus on Patient Safety and Stringent Regulations</b></li> </ul>\n<p>Stricter government mandates and a heightened global emphasis on patient safety are compelling healthcare facilities to adopt sophisticated <mark>infection</mark> control protocols. Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) issue global strategies and guidelines to strengthen <mark>Infection</mark> Prevention and Control (IPC) programs, which are then reinforced by national policies. This regulatory push drives market activity. For example, mandatory public reporting of <mark>infection</mark> rates and financial penalties tied to high HAI rates&mdash;as seen in major healthcare markets like North America&mdash;motivate hospitals to invest heavily in advanced monitoring systems and automation. This environment fosters strategic collaborations and acquisitions, such as a major medical device company&rsquo;s recent acquisition of complementary sterilization container and instrumentation assets to expand its <mark>infection</mark> prevention portfolio.</p>\n<ul> <li><b>Continuous Technological Advancements and Innovation</b></li> </ul>\n<p>The market is significantly propelled by the introduction of next-generation <mark>infection</mark> control technologies that offer improved efficacy and efficiency. Innovations are transforming sterilization, dis<mark>infection</mark>, and surveillance processes. Concrete examples include the rapid adoption of low-temperature hydrogen peroxide vapor systems for sterilizing heat-sensitive surgical instruments and the development of UV-C dis<mark>infection</mark> robots. These robots have shown the capability to eliminate over <b>99.9%</b> of <mark>pathogens</mark> in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, continuous product improvements are seen in the consumables segment, which holds the largest revenue share in the market, driven by the persistent demand for single-use products like sterile wraps, drapes, and high-performance respirators.</p>\n<p><b>Key Trends in the <mark>Infection</mark> Control Market</b></p>\n<ul> <li><b>Integration of AI and Automation in Surveillance</b></li> </ul>\n<p>An emerging and impactful trend is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automated systems for real-time <mark>infection</mark> surveillance. This moves <mark>infection</mark> control from reactive to predictive. AI-driven platforms leverage hospital data to track <mark>infection</mark> patterns, predict potential outbreaks, and guide optimal antibiotic selection, which is crucial for antibiotic stewardship efforts. Automated dis<mark>infection</mark> systems, such as UV-C and hydrogen peroxide vapor devices, are increasingly being deployed, offering documented reductions in <mark>infection</mark> rates. For instance, some healthcare facilities have reported a notable 30% reduction in difficult-to-treat <mark>infection</mark>s after implementing automated terminal room dis<mark>infection</mark> combined with predictive monitoring tools.</p>\n<ul> <li><b>Expansion of <mark>Infection</mark> Control into Non-Healthcare Settings</b></li> </ul>\n<p>The <mark>infection</mark> control market is experiencing significant growth outside of traditional hospital and clinic environments, extending into industries like food processing, hospitality, education, and public transportation. Heightened public awareness of germ transmission, amplified by recent global health events, has driven this demand. This trend is evident in the projected substantial growth for <mark>infection</mark> control solutions in non-healthcare sectors, with some estimates suggesting an increase of over <b>15%</b> in the next few years. Companies are now tailoring professional-grade surface disinfectants and hand hygiene products for institutional use, and there is an increased deployment of air filtration and purification systems in public buildings to meet these new, elevated hygiene expectations.</p>\n<ul> <li><b>Shift Toward Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Products</b></li> </ul>\n<p>Sustainability and environmental impact are becoming central considerations for purchasers of <mark>infection</mark> control products. This trend involves a rising demand for eco-friendly and reusable alternatives to traditional single-use consumables. Manufacturers are responding by developing biodegradable or plant-based disinfectants and wipes and exploring innovative, reusable materials for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as surgical gowns and sterilization wraps. The market is witnessing a focus on reducing reliance on ethylene oxide sterilization due to environmental concerns, leading to greater adoption of alternative low-temperature sterilization methods. This movement is driven by both regulatory pressures and the desire of large healthcare provider networks to meet their own organizational environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.</p>\n<p>We explore the factors driving the growth of the market, including technological advancements, consumer behaviors, and regulatory changes, along with emerging <a href=\"https://www.imarcgroup.com/<mark>infection</mark>-control-market\"><b><mark>infection</mark> control market trends</b></a>.</p>\n<p><b>Leading Companies Operating in the Global <mark>Infection</mark> Control Industry:</b></p>\n<ul> <li>3M Company</li> <li>Advanced Sterlization Products Services Inc.

        "full_content_html": "<figure><figcaption>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When Dr. Demetre Daskalakis stepped away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/demetre-daskalakis-blistering-resignation\">his resignation</a> as director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases did not land quietly. It detonated.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I find that the views [Health and Human Services Secretary <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/health/office-infectious-diseases-hiv-closing\">Robert F. Kennedy Jr</a>.] and his staff have shared challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency and in the service of the health of the American people. Enough is enough,&rdquo; he wrote in a resignation letter he shared publicly on social media.</p>\n<p>He said he was leaving because the CDC, the once-premier public health agency tasked with protecting the health of people in the U.S., had been transformed into a political instrument, with its scientific mission subverted, vulnerable populations erased, and evidence distorted. The agency, he wrote, had submitted to &ldquo;radical non-transparency&rdquo; and &ldquo;unskilled manipulation of data.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What is happening at the CDC is part of the second <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/demetre-daskalakis-cdc-resignation-interview\">Trump administration&rsquo;s attack on science</a>. The administration has cut billions of dollars from cancer research, vaccine research, and other breakthroughs the medical community had been working on for decades.</p>\n<p> Dr. Demetre DaskalakisAlyssa Pointer</p>\n<p>Now, on the outside, Daskalakis and others worry about those still inside. &ldquo;I feel bad for my people who are inside the CDC,&rdquo; Daskalakis says. &ldquo;The CDC is now a weapon. That is why I left. The weaponization of public health is happening, and I am not crying wolf.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Part of why his warnings resonate is the messenger himself. Daskalakis is a tattooed, out gay infectious disease physician who speaks plainly about queer sexual culture, goes clubbing, and wears harnesses at charity galas.</p>\n<p>After Daskalakis&rsquo;s resignation, <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/homophobe-rand-paul-slams-daskalakis\">U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky</a> called him &ldquo;a guy that is so far out of the mainstream, I think most people in America would discount his opinion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Daskalakis leans into the drama.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the garbage,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You want to come for me? Come for me. You&rsquo;re just making me more trusted in the community that I love.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>A 49-year-old Toy Doctor&rsquo;s Kit</h2>\n<p>For more than two decades, Daskalakis has been a through line in America&rsquo;s responses to HIV, <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/severe-mpox-strain-warning\">mpox</a>, measles, and other respiratory <mark>infection</mark>s, including COVID-19. His mix of technical fluency, cultural competence, and moral clarity has made him one of queer public health&rsquo;s most trusted messengers. Today, he is sounding the loudest warning of his career.</p>\n<p>During a recent video interview with <em>The Advocate</em>, Daskalakis, 52, retrieved an object from off-camera: his Fisher-Price doctor&rsquo;s kit from when he was 3 years old.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is 49 years old. It is in pristine condition, because this is why I wanted to be a doctor,&rdquo; he says, holding up the plastic box containing a play stethoscope and other toy medical tools.</p>\n<p>Daskalakis grew up in Northern Virginia without physician role models. He is the son of Greek immigrants, and his grandmother spoke only Greek. As a child, he would take imaginary temperatures of his grandmother&rsquo;s friends, and if they refused, he would announce they could leave.</p>\n<p> Dr. Daskalakis in front of his former place of employment, the CDCAlyssa Pointer</p>\n<p>Bullied in high school, he responded by becoming class president and yearbook editor. At Columbia University, he studied Buddhism under Robert Thurman. &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s [actress] Uma&rsquo;s dad,&rdquo; Daskalakis chuckles. The Dalai Lama visited his class on the final day. He majored in both biology and religion, crafting a thesis on the intersection of technology and transcendence.</p>\n<p>But it was an interest in HIV that inspired him. As a resident assistant in undergrad, Daskalakis organized an <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/aids-memorial-quilt-white-house\">AIDS Memorial Quilt</a> display to benefit New York charity God&rsquo;s Love We Deliver. He carried a panel through San Francisco International Airport, overwhelmed by its weight and shape. On College Walk, Columbia&rsquo;s main artery, he watched mourners collapse over names sewn into fabric.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is what I want to do,&rdquo; he remembers thinking at the time. &ldquo;Make sure that people don&rsquo;t have to die from this disease anymore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His path from that moment forward reads like an index of the crises that shaped late 20th- and early 21st-century queer life. In medical school at New York University and later during his residency at Harvard&rsquo;s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Daskalakis cared for people living with advanced AIDS. As a resident at Fenway Health, he met his first <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/transgender\">transgender</a> patients. At Harvard, he earned his master&rsquo;s of public health degree.</p>\n<p>After hearing a radio report about a case of <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> HIV in New York City, he rushed back to the city, launching HIV testing programs in venues like Paddles, the city&rsquo;s iconic leather and fetish club. There, he built trust where others feared to tread. In one now-legendary story, a leather-clad man handcuffed him to a leather pagoda mid-test.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can test you while I&rsquo;m handcuffed,&rdquo; he told the man calmly. &ldquo;But when I&rsquo;m done, you&rsquo;re going to uncuff me.&rdquo; He then continued the appointment one-handed.</p>\n<p>Eventually, his work led him to the highest echelons of public health. As New York City&rsquo;s deputy commissioner for disease control, he helped steer responses to HIV, meningitis, measles, and COVID-19. Later, at the CDC, he oversaw HIV prevention nationwide.</p>\n<p> Dr. Demetre DaskalakisAlyssa Pointer</p>\n<h2>A Hostage Situation</h2>\n<p>The CDC&rsquo;s collapse is not theoretical, Daskalakis says. It is operational, ideological, and moving quickly. &ldquo;The scientists are amazing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But the scientists are being held hostage in a system that will not allow them to do their job.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In November, the CDC abruptly altered its vaccines and autism web page to imply a possible link that has been discredited by every major scientific body. The change bypassed all normal review. No scientific experts were consulted, no internal process was followed, and the divisions responsible for vaccine science were not notified.</p>\n<p>Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC&rsquo;s former chief medical officer, who resigned alongside Daskalakis, says the episode captured the crisis precisely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;None of the scientific leaders at three of the centers that would have been aware of that change had been consulted,&rdquo; she says. The top of the agency, she adds, is now packed with political appointees. &ldquo;Usually, there are two to three. I think there are 13 now, maybe more. The right part of the CDC is still there. It is that top layer where they are not engaging career staff.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And the consequences are immediate. &ldquo;If somebody goes to the CDC website and sees the information on vaccines and autism, they might question whether to get their child vaccinated,&rdquo; Houry says. &ldquo;We know that it is safe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr. Nikki Romanik, distinguished senior fellow in global health security at Brown University&rsquo;s School of Public Health and former deputy director and chief of staff for the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, says the collapse was visible from the inside long before the public saw it. &ldquo;Public health only works if the science is intact,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When scientific review is sidelined, everything else falls apart.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To Daskalakis, the pattern is unmistakable. Fringe theories and pseudoscientific briefings have begun replacing evidence. The &ldquo;Tylenol moment&rdquo; &mdash; when President Donald Trump and Secretary Kennedy told pregnant people to avoid acetaminophen because of <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/texas-attorney-general-sues-tylenol-manufacturer\">unproven links to autism</a> &mdash; was galling. The drug has been deemed safe during pregnancy when taken as directed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is a concerted effort to get people to mistrust experts, science, doctors,&rdquo; he says. In a landscape where the Food and Drug Administration is destabilized, the familiar refrain to &ldquo;do your own research&rdquo; becomes a vacuum in which misinformation takes hold.</p>\n<p>Dr. Daniel Jernigan, former director of the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, calls the vaccine website shift a rupture. &ldquo;It was completely inaccurate without any CDC staff providing any input,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is astounding.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The breaking point for Jernigan, Houry, and Daskalakis came when Kennedy fired newly confirmed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, who had committed to protecting the scientific process. &ldquo;That pushed us across it,&rdquo; Jernigan says. &ldquo;We resigned so we could speak out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The trio, <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/demetre-daskalakis-blistering-resignation\">who call themselves &ldquo;D3,&rdquo;</a> describe an agency stripped of its core functions. Where the CDC once anchored the national public health system, it is now, Daskalakis says, &ldquo;a place where they have demonstrated that they are untrustworthy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He adds that the public health infrastructure itself is breaking and points to the dismantling of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response. &ldquo;When we had bird flu, I had people I could talk to in the White House,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That is gone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Romanik, who ran that office under the Biden administration, agrees. &ldquo;The office was gutted,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There was no one left to coordinate anything when the next emergency hits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> A supporter snaps a selfie with Dr. Daskalakis in Atlanta, GeorgiaAlyssa Pointer</p>\n<h2>An Erasure of LGBTQ+ Data</h2>\n<p>When mpox emerged in 2022, Daskalakis watched the early weeks of the outbreak with growing concern. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know anything about health in the way you need to know to deal with something transmitted in the context of sexual activity in most people in the U.S.,&rdquo; he recalls.</p>\n<p>What crossed his mind was &ldquo;I think they need some help,&rdquo; he remembers.</p>\n<p>Jernigan, whose expertise includes pox viruses, says Daskalakis was indispensable. &ldquo;He was way out in front and doing the right thing. If we had not had him, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how we would&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>But tracking and responding to future outbreaks in the queer community will be made more difficult by the administration&rsquo;s efforts to erase data about transgender, nonbinary, and LGBTQ+ people from health guidance and data systems.</p>\n<p>Romanik speaks bluntly about the human cost of that erasure. &ldquo;How many times can you kick a specific population in the gut before they go underground and stop getting preventative care? It breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s lost, she says, is not just scientific accuracy but the basic conditions for dignity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You should not try to erase any type of population ever,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And you shouldn&rsquo;t ever try to make people feel that their health is not important.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>The Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Public health today requires what it has always required, Daskalakis says. Not only science but courage. Not only data but trust. Not only expertise but community.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Open your ears and your eyes and listen,&rdquo; Daskalakis says. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an asshole.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2026, Daskalakis is beginning a new chapter as chief medical officer at Callen-Lorde, the nation&rsquo;s flagship LGBTQ+ community health system in New York City. Built after Stonewall and serving tens of thousands of patients annually, Callen-Lorde remains a national model for culturally competent LGBTQ+ health care.</p>\n<p>For him, the move is a return to the community-anchored work that shaped him. The CDC may be unrecognizable. But Daskalakis is not. His voice &mdash; sharp, grounded, and unafraid &mdash; remains unmistakably ours.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to follow your North Star,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But you are not the one who decides where the North Star goes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> Jan-Feb 2026 cover of The Advocatephotography by Alyssa Pointer</p>",

This lung <mark>infection</mark>-causing pathogen is related to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, but it poses less of a biosafety hazard to the researchers.</p>\n<p>The team stained <em>M. abscessus </em>with a dye that signals viability and treated them with eight antibiotic drugs for three days. To monitor killing, they took images every two to four hours for three days. The researchers tracked the &ldquo;time-kill kinetics&rdquo; for each cell, a metric which indicates how quickly each drug kills the <mark>bacteria</mark>. Next, the team tested if ASCT is more predictive of antibiotic treatment outcomes for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> <mark>infection</mark>s in living organisms than in a standard growth inhibition assay. They first used ASCT to evaluate how well the 65 antibiotic combinations killed two avirulent strains of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. Then, they leveraged data from existing mouse and human studies and categorized antibiotic drug combinations depending on how well they mitigate <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/sweet-deception-how-myco<mark>bacteria</mark>-exploit-immune-receptors-to-survive-73921\"><em>M. tuberculosis </em><mark>infection</mark>s</a> in mice and humans relative to the standard-of-care regimen.<sup>2-5</sup> The researchers found that ASCT could distinguish between drugs that were &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; standard-of-care and their &ldquo;better than&rdquo; counterparts, but the growth inhibition assay could not.</p>\n<p>To better understand how different strains of myco<mark>bacteria</mark> tolerate antibiotic treatment, Boeck&rsquo;s team studied clinical isolates of <em>M. abscessus </em>from 405 patients. The researchers investigated how well <em>M. abscessus</em> tolerated eight commonly used antibiotics for up to 72 hours, tracking more than 100 million individual cells in total. They discovered that the isolates&rsquo; responses to antibiotics were different from one another, indicating that <mark>bacteria</mark>l strain differences influence antibiotic tolerance.</p>\n<p>Boeck hopes that ASCT can one day help <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/scientists-use-pharmacogenomics-to-provide-personalized-medicine-73857\">personalize drug regimens</a> to each patient and the pathogen they are fighting.</p>",

On this occasion, the Minister for Science and Technology, Arjun Modhwadia, was also present.</p>\n<p>During this ceremony, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, granted a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the Gujarat Science and Technology Department to designate the 'Bio Safety Level-4' facility of the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) as the 'National Centre for High Containment Pathogen Research Facility' under the Government of India's 'BioE3 Policy'.</p>\n<p>The Union Home Minister stated that a new era has begun in Gujarat for the development of India's health security and biosafety sector. After Pune, this is only the second such high-level lab in the country; however, due to the state government's special initiative, it will become the country's first state government-operated BSL-4 lab, to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 362 crore. In the future, this lab will prove to be India's impregnable security shield and a strong fortress of bio-facilities to combat deadly viruses.</p>\n<p>Reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision that 'science and technology should be the foundation pillar of national development', he said, 'This international-standard lab will open many avenues of opportunity for researchers and youth. Especially, this lab will accelerate the 'One Health Mission' initiated by the Prime Minister to prevent diseases transmitted from animals to humans.' In the face of recent challenges such as Chandipura and Lumpy Skin Disease in Gujarat, a research-based, permanent security arrangement was essential.'</p>\n<p>Presenting figures reflecting the revolutionary transformation in India's biotechnology sector, he said, 'unprecedented progress has been made in the last 11 years'. India's bio-economy, which stood at 10 billion dollars in 2014, has grown to over 166 billion dollars by 2024. Given that research is the 'soul of innovation', and thanks to the infrastructure provided by the central government, Indian scientists today are conducting world-class research in a highly secure environment.</p>\n<p>Highlighting growth in the startup and investment sectors, he noted that in 2014, there were fewer than 500 startups in this field; today, there are more than 10,000. Similarly, the number of incubators has increased from 6 to 95, and incubation space has expanded from 60,000 square feet to 9 lakh square feet. Notably, private investment funding has increased from Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 7,000 crore, and the number of patent filings has risen from 125 to over 1,300, indicating that India's youth are now becoming 'job givers' rather than 'job seekers'.</p>\n<p>He stated that under the Government of India's 'BioE3 Policy', there is a resolve to take the country to greater heights in the biotechnology sector. India today is indigenously manufacturing vaccines for serious diseases such as COVID-19 and cervical cancer. He called upon students and researchers, stating that the responsibility of ensuring India's health security now rests on their shoulders. This lab will enable many positive transformations in the health sector in the coming years.</p>\n<p>He stated that under the Prime Minister's leadership, India is moving forward by integrating 'development' and 'heritage'. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian scientists developed vaccines quickly, safeguarding 140 crore citizens and helping the world, based on the approach of making science and technology a foundational pillar of national development.</p>\n<p>With this lab, Indian scientists will no longer need to rely on foreign countries for sample testing, thereby fulfilling the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' objective in the health sector. He expressed confidence that by 2027, India will also be among the world's leading nations in the semiconductor and biotechnology sectors.</p>\n<p>He expressed concern about the 'silent disaster' of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>) driven by antibiotic misuse and urged students and researchers to protect the next generation through research. He called upon students studying in the biotech sector to make the most of national facilities to develop pharmaceutical formulations and vaccines that benefit human life and help achieve the goal of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047. This facility will emerge as a protective shield not only for Gujarat but for the entire country.</p>\n<p>As the country moves towards 'Viksit Bharat' under the guidance of the Prime Minister, science, such as biotechnology, will provide us with security, while heritage, such as the Somnath Swabhiman Parva, will give us a proud identity. India today is building the edifice of modern science on the foundation of culture.

Despite the widespread application of antimicrobial therapies and repeated catheter exchanges, these tenacious <mark>bacteria</mark> manage to survive and adapt, evading eradication in ways that challenge current clinical paradigms. This new genomic investigation sheds light on the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms enabling S. aureus to maintain chronic <mark>infection</mark>s in an environment altered by medical intervention.</p>\n<p>Long-term urinary catheterization, a common treatment modality in patients with chronic urinary retention or neurological dysfunction, has long been associated with an increased risk of urinary tract <mark>infection</mark>s (UTIs). While it is well understood that catheter-associated UTIs predominantly involve biofilm-forming <mark>bacteria</mark>, the precise dynamics and microbial adaptations during protracted catheterization have remained elusive&mdash;until now. The recent study harnessed cutting-edge whole-genome sequencing techniques to track <mark>bacteria</mark>l populations longitudinally from patients with indwelling catheters, thereby illuminating the genomic adaptations enabling S. aureus persistence despite aggressive antimicrobial measures.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the investigation was an extensive genomic surveillance protocol, where isolates of S. aureus were sequentially collected across multiple months from urinary samples as well as from catheter surfaces. These samples underwent deep sequencing to decipher the genomic evolution of the <mark>bacteria</mark>l populations over time. Intriguingly, the data revealed that S. aureus strains not only survived repeated cycles of antibiotic treatment and physical catheter exchanges but also exhibited genomic signatures of adaptive evolution, including mutations conferring enhanced biofilm formation and <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>.</p>\n<p>The persistence of S. aureus in the urinary tract under such stringent selective pressures highlights the complexity of microbial survival strategies in chronic <mark>infection</mark>s. Biofilms, complex microbial communities encased in extracellular polymeric substances, serve as a fortress shielding <mark>bacteria</mark> from both host immune responses and pharmaceutical interventions. The study discovered that S. aureus biofilms on catheters displayed upregulated expression of genes involved in polysaccharide production and adhesion factors, critical components for establishing robust and recalcitrant <mark>bacteria</mark>l communities.</p>\n<p>One particularly concerning finding was the demonstration of increased <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> over time in the S. aureus populations isolated from these patients. Mutations in genes related to antibiotic target sites and efflux pump systems were enriched by the end of the observation period, reflecting a classic example of within-host evolution driving resistance. This adaptation renders conventional antibiotic regimens increasingly ineffective, underscoring the urgent need for novel antimicrobial strategies tailored to these resilient <mark>infection</mark>s.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the study&rsquo;s genomic analysis provided evidence of intra-patient diversification and microevolution, suggesting that S. aureus does not persist as a homogeneous population but rather as a dynamic and heterogenous consortium. Such diversity within the <mark>bacteria</mark>l community presents significant challenges for treatment, as different subpopulations may exhibit distinct susceptibilities to antibiotics or host defenses, facilitating overall <mark>infection</mark> survival.</p>\n<p>The clinical implications of these findings are profound. Persistent S. aureus <mark>infection</mark>s during long-term catheterization significantly elevate the risk of severe complications, including ascending UTIs, bacteremia, and sepsis. Recognizing the genomic and phenotypic plasticity of S. aureus in this context urges re-evaluation of current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. For instance, reliance on intermittent urine cultures may underestimate the complexity of <mark>infection</mark>, while standard antimicrobial protocols may inadvertently select for more resistant and biofilm-adapted strains.</p>\n<p>Highlighting the importance of personalized medicine, the authors advocate for integrating genomic diagnostics into clinical workflows to monitor <mark>bacteria</mark>l evolution during chronic catheterization. Such an approach could enable timely detection of resistance emergence and inform targeted therapeutic interventions, potentially improving patient outcomes. Additionally, understanding the molecular underpinnings of biofilm resilience offers opportunities to develop adjuvant therapies disrupting biofilm integrity, thereby enhancing antibiotic efficacy.</p>\n<p>This study also reignites interest in the exploration of non-antibiotic strategies for controlling catheter-associated S. aureus <mark>infection</mark>s. The persistent nature of these <mark>pathogens</mark> despite catheter exchanges indicates that replacement alone is insufficient, necessitating adjunct treatments. Approaches such as catheter coatings with anti-adhesive or antimicrobial properties, use of bacterio<mark>phage therapy</mark>, or immune modulation to enhance host defense may represent promising future directions informed by the detailed genomic insights provided here.</p>\n<p>From a broader microbial ecology perspective, these findings contribute to an evolving understanding of <mark>bacteria</mark>l persistence within human-associated medical devices. The urinary tract environment presents unique challenges&mdash;constant fluid flow, varying nutrient availability, and host immune surveillance&mdash;that shape microbial strategies. The demonstrated adaptability of S. aureus underscores its remarkable evolutionary fitness, as it exploits niche-specific selective pressures to ensure survival despite clinical interventions.</p>\n<p>In summary, this transformative research deciphers the genomic basis by which Staphylococcus aureus perseveres during prolonged urinary catheterization, challenging the prevailing therapeutic dogma. High-throughput sequencing unveiled a dynamic landscape of <mark>bacteria</mark>l adaptation, encompassing biofilm enhancement, <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, and population diversification. These findings not only clarify the clinical obstinacy of catheter-associated S. aureus <mark>infection</mark>s but also pave the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat this pressing healthcare problem.</p>\n<p>As catheter-associated <mark>infection</mark>s persist as a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide, the study&rsquo;s insights stress the imperative to innovate beyond traditional antibiotic use. The integration of genomics into <mark>infection</mark> surveillance marks a paradigm shift towards precision infectious disease management, where understanding microbial evolution in real-time may become the key to outmaneuvering resistant <mark>pathogens</mark>. The molecular blueprint provided here for S. aureus persistence thus represents a critical step forward in the ongoing battle against chronic device-associated <mark>infection</mark>s.</p>\n<p>By unraveling the adaptive pathways exploited by S. aureus, this research invites renewed focus on the interplay between microbial evolution and medical device technologies. With catheter usage only increasing due to aging populations and complex medical needs, the urgency to develop effective measures against resilient <mark>bacteria</mark>l colonization intensifies. This study stands as a clarion call for interdisciplinary efforts bridging microbiology, genomics, and clinical practice to safeguard patients from these insidious <mark>infection</mark>s.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the implications extend beyond urinary catheter-associated <mark>infection</mark>s. The principles revealed&mdash;where persistent <mark>bacteria</mark> evolve under host and clinical pressures&mdash;likely apply to myriad chronic <mark>infection</mark>s involving indwelling devices or other sites of <mark>bacteria</mark>l biofilms. The comprehensive genomic approach demonstrated herein offers a powerful template for dissecting and countering microbial persistence, steering the future of infectious disease research and treatment toward a precise, informed, and adaptive framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Subject of Research</strong>: Persistence mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus during long-term urinary catheterization under antimicrobial therapy and catheter exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Article Title</strong>: Genomics reveal Staphylococcus aureus persists during long-term urinary catheterization despite antimicrobial therapy and catheter exchanges.</p>\n<p><strong>Article References</strong>:<br>\n Duran Ramirez, J.M., Armbruster, C.E., Hanson, B.M. et al.

The drug resistance renders antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines ineffective, and <mark>infection</mark>s become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability, and death.</p>\n<p>&quot;<mark>AMR</mark> means resistance developed against antibiotics. This is a huge threat to our society and humanity today. It is, in a way, a silent disaster. <mark>AMR</mark> means a reduction or complete loss of the effectiveness of antibiotics,&quot; said Shah.</p>\n<p>He identified three main reasons for <mark>AMR</mark>: not finishing the course of antibiotics, doctors prescribing antibiotics without a proper diagnosis, and using antibiotics without a doctor's advice.</p>\n<p>&quot;I believe that <mark>AMR</mark> is a very serious threat, not just for individuals, but for society as a whole. If we compromise the human body's ability to repair using antibiotics, we won't be able to control diseases. There is a need for further research to make this science more precise and robust,&quot; said Shah.</p>\n<p>He said the <mark>AMR</mark> threat extends to vertical transmission because it can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her child.</p>\n<p>&quot;Therefore, we need a roadmap to combat <mark>AMR</mark>. We need medicine literacy and research, and need to educate people about its dangers. This should be the goal of the students sitting before me today. Our goal should also be to prevent <mark>infection</mark>s and to safeguard antibiotics for future generations,&quot; said the Home Minister.</p>\n<p>Shah said Gujarat has become the first state to establish the BSL-4 facility where scientists can research contagious viruses.</p>\n<p>BSL-4 (Biosafety Level 4) is the highest level of biosafety containment for handling dangerous and contagious microorganisms that can cause severe or fatal diseases, with no available vaccines or treatments.</p>\n<p>&quot;Science and technology should not be limited to Research and Development alone. Rather, it should be a cornerstone of the nation's overall development. And today, we are taking a very crucial step in that direction. In a way, after the Virology Institute in Pune, this will be India's second such high-tech lab,&quot; said Shah.</p>\n<p>He added that this is the first such laboratory being built by a state government, and the credit goes to Gujarat. &quot;A strong fortress for India's biosafety is being built here at a cost of Rs 362 crore in over 11,000 square meters of area,&quot; said Shah.</p>\n<p>He said that, though India, to an extent, (lagged) behind in this area for many years, this new facility will provide a new opportunity to young minds working in this field, and India will eventually move forward in this sector.</p>\n<p>&quot;This facility will provide scientists with a platform to conduct research on highly contagious viruses in a completely safe environment.

Citing studies indicating that <strong>60&ndash;70% of infectious diseases originate from animals</strong>, he underlined the importance of India&rsquo;s <strong>One Health Mission</strong>, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health.</p>\n<p>Shri Shah emphasized that once operational, Indian scientists will <strong>no longer depend on foreign laboratories</strong> for testing dangerous virus samples. This will accelerate testing timelines, enhance preparedness, and significantly strengthen <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat</strong> in health security.</p>\n<h3>Rapid Growth of India&rsquo;s Biotechnology Sector</h3>\n<p>Highlighting the transformation of India&rsquo;s bio-economy over the past decade, Shri Amit Shah said:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p>India&rsquo;s bio-economy grew from <strong>USD 10 billion in 2014</strong> to <strong>USD 166 billion by FY 2024</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>17-fold growth in 10 years</strong>, demonstrating the potential of India&rsquo;s youth and entrepreneurs</p> </li> </ul>\n<p>He noted that:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p>Biotechnology startups increased from <strong>fewer than 500 in 2014</strong> to <strong>over 10,000 by 2025</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Bio-incubators rose from <strong>6 to 95</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Incubation space expanded from <strong>60,000 sq. ft. to 9 lakh sq. ft.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>More than <strong>800 biotech products</strong> are now in the market</p> </li> </ul>\n<h3>Innovation, Patents, and Investment Surge</h3>\n<p>Shri Shah pointed out that patent filings reflect the future of any sector:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>125 biotech patents filed in 2014</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1,300 patents by 2025</strong></p> </li> </ul>\n<p>Private investment in the sector has surged from <strong>₹10 crore</strong> to <strong>₹7,000 crore</strong>, reinforcing confidence in India&rsquo;s biotechnology ecosystem. He stated that India&rsquo;s youth in this sector have proved they are <strong>job creators, not job seekers</strong>.</p>\n<h3>India as a Global Vaccine Powerhouse</h3>\n<p>The Home Minister described India as the <strong>world&rsquo;s largest vaccine producer</strong>, manufacturing <strong>60% of global vaccine supply</strong>. He highlighted key achievements such as:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p>India&rsquo;s <strong>first indigenous cervical cancer vaccine (Cervavac)</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>The <strong>world&rsquo;s first DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine</strong></p> </li> </ul>\n<p>These, he said, demonstrate India&rsquo;s capacity to lead globally in biomedical innovation.</p>\n<h3>Policy Support and Strategic Missions</h3>\n<p>Shri Shah noted that the Government of India is advancing biotechnology through:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>Bio E-3 Policy</strong> (Economy, Environment, Employment)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Genome India Project</strong>, with genome sequencing data of over <strong>10,000 individuals</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Strong integration with national initiatives such as the <strong>Deep Ocean Mission</strong>, where GBRC plays a critical role</p> </li> </ul>\n<p>Under Gujarat&rsquo;s biotechnology policy, targets have been set for:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>₹20,000 crore investment</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1 lakh jobs</strong>, with special support for mega projects</p> </li> </ul>\n<h3>Gujarat&rsquo;s Leadership in Biotechnology</h3>\n<p>Recalling that the <strong>Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission</strong> was launched two decades ago on the vision of Shri Narendra Modi, Shri Shah said that what once seemed like a dream has now positioned Gujarat among the <strong>top five biotech states in India</strong>. With the operationalisation of the BSL-4 facility, Gujarat is poised to <strong>emerge as the leading state</strong> in biotechnology.</p>\n<p>He also recalled that Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the <strong>Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre in 2018</strong> and established <strong>Asia&rsquo;s first dedicated biotechnology university</strong>, marking a turning point for the sector.</p>\n<h3>Lessons from COVID-19 and Future Preparedness</h3>\n<p>Shri Shah reflected on the COVID-19 pandemic, stating that India responded more effectively than many developed nations. He highlighted:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p>Vaccination of <strong>1.4 billion people</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Instant digital certification via mobile phones</p> </li> <li> <p>Development of indigenous vaccines</p> </li> <li> <p>Supply of vaccines to <strong>70 countries</strong></p> </li> </ul>\n<p>He said the new BSL-4 facility will further enhance India&rsquo;s preparedness for future pandemics and public health emergencies.</p>\n<h3>Addressing the Threat of <mark>Antimicrobial Resistance</mark></h3>\n<p>The Home Minister warned that <strong><mark>Antimicrobial Resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>)</strong> is a &ldquo;silent disaster&rdquo; threatening humanity. He stressed the need for:</p>\n<ul> <li> <p>A clear national roadmap</p> </li> <li> <p>Timely treatment protocols</p> </li> <li> <p>Public awareness</p> </li> <li> <p>Preventive strategies to preserve antibiotics for future generations</p> </li> </ul>\n<h3>Heritage and Science: Complementary, Not Contradictory</h3>\n<p>Drawing a powerful parallel, Shri Amit Shah recalled the <strong>Somnath Swabhiman Parv</strong> celebrated by Prime Minister Modi a day earlier. He described the Somnath temple&mdash;destroyed <strong>16 times and rebuilt every time</strong>&mdash;as a symbol of India&rsquo;s civilizational resilience.</p>\n<p>He emphasized that <strong>science and heritage are not opposites</strong>, but complementary forces. The foundation of the BSL-4 lab a day after the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, he said, reflects how <strong>India advances modern science while remaining rooted in its cultural heritage</strong>.</p>\n<h3>A Strong Foundation for India&rsquo;s Bio-Secure Future</h3>\n<p>Concluding his address, Shri Amit Shah said the BSL-4 Bio-Containment Facility will not only protect India&rsquo;s health security but also empower scientists, inspire youth, and reinforce India&rsquo;s position as a global leader in biotechnology&mdash;aligning science, self-reliance, and heritage on the path toward a stronger and healthier nation.</p>",

As immune profiling becomes essential for understanding disease, guiding precision medicine, and developing new therapies, PreciMune offers unmatched resolution with real-world usability. Researchers gain deeper, more cost-effective insights, while clinicians can better select patients for advanced therapies (e.g., personalized form of cancer immunotherapies), monitor treatment responses earlier, and reduce waste and toxicity.</p>\n<p>The FIT-InnoTREK grant will support Dr Johanna Chiffelle in productizing and deploying the technology and securing the first customers, accelerating the platform&rsquo;s impact across multiple precision medicine markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Tamaro Bioscience: &lsquo;off-the-shelf&rsquo; CAR T-cell therapies to fight cancer</strong><br>\nIn the fight against cancer, one proven strategy to re-activate an immune response against cancer cells consists in inserting a synthetic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in patients&rsquo; T-cells (immune cells). This gene-modification is typically performed <em>ex vivo</em>, using man-made synthetic (artificial) proteins. Once reinfused in patients, CAR T-cells trigger an immune response and selectively kill cancer cells. While they have transformed treatment of blood cancers, broad impact is limited by patient-specific manufacturing (1 batch = 1 patient).</p>\n<p>The UNIL-CHUV spin-off Tamaro Bioscience shifts the paradigm by modifying T-cells from healthy donors, instead of each patients&rsquo; cells and thereby enables to treat 100+ unrelated patients from 1 production batch. It enables simultaneous insertion of a CAR and removal of immune rejection genes to avoid CAR T-cell rejection in unrelated patients, thus creating an affordable, and scalable &lsquo;off-the-shelf&rsquo; product for on demand treatment.</p>\n<p>With the FIT-InnoTREK grant, Dr Jimmy Maillard will lead fundraising and strategic development, prepare freedom-to-operate and regulatory documents, plan clinical trial activities, and develop commercialization strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Germion Therapeutics: a new class of antibiotics to outsmart resistant <mark>bacteria</mark></strong><br>\n<mark>Antimicrobial resistance</mark> threatens to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Current antibiotics are failing, and few new classes have reached the clinic for decades. Active development either focuses on optimisation of the already-available scaffolds (susceptible to resistance due to the share mechanisms) or in complex and expensive solutions (e.g. <mark>phage therapy</mark>).</p>\n<p>Stemming out of EPFL, and with the support of an international team of collaborators, Germion&rsquo;s solution addresses this urgent and rising need by developing a simple and novel class of metalloid-based antibiotics in an unexplored chemical space, and that display a unique mechanism of action, offering an alternative where current therapies are failing.</p>\n<p>The FIT-Innogrant will support Dr Jan Romano-deGea&rsquo;s efforts towards <em>in vivo</em> de-risking, the development of a second-generation of antibiotics with activity against Gram-negative <mark>pathogens</mark>, and the creation of clinical, regulatory and IP roadmaps, paving the way for startup incorporation and investor readiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Obstetrical Care Solutions (OCS) brings real-time 3D visualization to safer, smarter childbirth</strong><br>\nFor decades, birth assistance has relied mainly on manual examination and the practitioner&rsquo;s mental reconstruction of maternal and foetal anatomy. Although ultrasound is now standard in delivery rooms, it offers only limited, cross-sectional views.</p>\n<p>OCS introduces a real-time 3D visualization system for assessment of childbirth biomechanics. This technology displays the pelvic bone, foetal head and, when relevant, obstetric instruments, providing a standardized framework for navigating complex deliveries and improving clinical consistency and patient care. Developed at EPFL and CHUV, the add-on to ultrasound devices integrates an optical tracking system with AI-driven 3D modelling and can incorporate tracked tools for guided procedures.</p>\n<p>With the FIT-Innogrant, Dr Sandra Marcadent and Dr Johann H&ecirc;ches will refine the prototype, conduct pre-clinical studies to confirm the new prototype quality, and lead fundraising to advance toward clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Battery as a service (BaaS): a battery platform to cut imbalance costs and boost grid flexibility</strong><br>\nIn the context of massive integration of intermittent solar energy into the Swiss electric grid and it impact on the energy imbalance penalties, the Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) spin-off from HEIG-VD has been awarded the FIT Tech Grant to build a new digital platform for flexibility procurement for small and mid-size electricity providers (balance groups) to mitigate these penalties. It virtualizes large scale battery energy storage systems (BESS), enabling balance groups to &ldquo;rent&rdquo; on-demand energy storage and reduce energy imbalance penalties by 25&ndash;30% by direct control over the rented batteries through APIs.</p>\n<p>Using advanced algorithms for dynamic pricing, optimized capacity planning and invoicing, the spin-off provides an end2end solution and facilitates the access to battery assets. By connecting multiple battery sites and offering short-term contracts, BaaS creates a decentralized flexibility marketplace that benefits both energy providers (no initial investment) as well as battery site investors (maximizes asset use and revenue diversification).</p>\n<p>With FIT&rsquo;s support, the project will deliver a full-scale prototype including 2 laboratory batteries at HEIG-VD, advancing Switzerland toward a more resilient, data-driven, and sustainable energy system.</p>\n<p><strong>➡️ Source: <a href=\"https://www.fondation-fit.ch/en/general/news/2026-en-us/fit-awards-5-new-tech-grants-to-projects-from-chuv-epfl-and-heig-vd\">FIT</a> | 📸 &copy;Obstetrical Care Solutions</strong></p>",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen known for <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> and biofilm formation, frequently causes persistent and difficult-to-treat lung <mark>infection</mark>s in older patients. While animal models have helped clarify <mark>infection</mark> mechanisms in young hosts, aged animals often fail to survive standard <mark>infection</mark> procedures, making chronic studies impossible. This gap has limited progress in understanding how aging alters immune responses and <mark>infection</mark> outcomes. Based on these challenges, there is a clear need to develop and optimize <mark>infection</mark> models specifically tailored for aged hosts.</p>\n<p>Researchers from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, report a refined mouse model that successfully mimics chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung <mark>infection</mark> in old age. <a href=\"https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/AGR.2025.9340059?utm_source=miragenews&utm_medium=miragenews&utm_campaign=news\">Published (DOI: 10.26599/AGR.2025.9340059) </a> in <a href=\"https://www.sciopen.com/journal/2957-8701?utm_source=miragenews&utm_medium=miragenews&utm_campaign=news\">Aging Research</a> in 2025, the study introduces an agar bead-based delivery strategy that allows <mark>bacteria</mark> to persist in the lungs of aged mice without causing rapid death. This methodological advance enables sustained observation of <mark>infection</mark> dynamics, tissue damage, and immune responses in aging lungs, addressing a long-standing limitation in experimental respiratory <mark>infection</mark> research.</p>\n<p>The researchers first confirmed that conventional intratracheal delivery of free-living P. aeruginosa is overwhelmingly lethal to aged mice, with all animals succumbing within 24 hours. This stark result underscored the extreme vulnerability of aging lungs and the unsuitability of standard approaches. To overcome this, the team encapsulated <mark>bacteria</mark> within agar beads before intratracheal administration.</p>\n<p>This modification dramatically changed <mark>infection</mark> outcomes. Instead of acute death, aged mice survived while maintaining persistent <mark>bacteria</mark>l colonization in the lungs for at least ten days. Quantitative analyses showed sustained <mark>bacteria</mark>l loads, confirming the establishment of a chronic <mark>infection</mark> rather than a transient exposure. Histological examination revealed hallmark features of chronic lung disease, including disrupted alveolar structure, inflammatory cell infiltration, and tissue consolidation.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the agar beads acted as a controlled-release system, allowing gradual <mark>bacteria</mark>l exposure that better reflects real-world chronic <mark>infection</mark>s in elderly patients. The model also proved reproducible, with consistent <mark>infection</mark> patterns across animals. Together, these results demonstrate that <mark>infection</mark> severity in aged hosts is not only pathogen-dependent but also strongly influenced by delivery dynamics&mdash;an insight with broad implications for aging research.</p>\n<p>&quot;This work solves a fundamental problem in aging-related <mark>infection</mark> research,&quot; the authors note. &quot;Aged organisms respond very differently to <mark>bacteria</mark>l challenges, and models designed for young animals can produce misleading or unusable results.&quot; By prioritizing host tolerance and <mark>infection</mark> persistence, the new approach allows researchers to study immune decline, <mark>bacteria</mark>l adaptation, and tissue damage over time. The team emphasizes that this model provides a practical foundation for mechanistic studies that were previously impossible due to high mortality in aged animals.</p>\n<p>This chronic <mark>infection</mark> model offers an essential tool for studying age-specific immune dysfunction, <mark>bacteria</mark>l persistence, and treatment resistance. It can be used to test antibiotics, anti-biofilm strategies, and immune-modulating therapies under conditions that closely resemble elderly lung <mark>infection</mark>s. Beyond P. aeruginosa, the approach may be adapted for other respiratory <mark>pathogens</mark> that disproportionately affect older populations. Ultimately, the model bridges experimental research and clinical reality, supporting the development of therapies tailored to aging patients rather than extrapolated from young, resilient hosts.</p>\n<p>Funding information</p>\n<p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81872207 and 82102575) and the Sichuan Science and Technology Bureau (No. 2025YFHZ0123).</p>\n<p>Aging Research</p>\n<p>Aging Research is an Open Access publication addressing the biology and medicine issues of aging and aging-related diseases.

Having developed resistance to almost all antibiotics used to treat it, only one last recommended treatment, ceftriaxone, remains effective, and now we are seeing a growing number of cases that are resistant to this. Even with the recent approval in late 2025 of two new first-in-class treatments for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, there is growing concern that without ongoing development of innovative new treatments, like Debio1453, the rapid emergence of resistance will see this &ldquo;super gonorrhea&rdquo; outpace antibiotic development.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a private company aligning our efforts with a not-for-profit organization, we see this collaboration with GARDP as a pioneering public-private model to expand global access to this innovative new drug candidate. The confirmation of this partnership is a powerful indicator of Debio1453&rsquo;s potential to replenish a critically depleted anti<mark>bacteria</mark>l pipeline, addressing a severe therapeutic gap,&rdquo; said Morgane Vanbiervliet, Director, Global Development and Licensing, Debiopharm. &ldquo;For those struggling with <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> gonorrhea, this agreement signals a decisive step toward restoring effective treatment options and ensuring long-term antibiotic sustainability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With crucial funding from the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant <mark>Bacteria</mark> Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X), the development of Debio1453 successfully progressed from a preclinical candidate to a clinical stage asset. As part of this new collaboration and license agreement, Debiopharm remains in charge of the completion of the Debio1453 Phase I clinical trial, while GARDP will lead other non-clinical and clinical development activities, as well as chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) activities. Both organizations aim to ensure that the global development and future access strategies of Debio1453 are aligned with country-specific regulatory requirements, health system realities and local economic constraints. Debiopharm has granted GARDP manufacturing and commercialization rights in relation to Debio1453 across more than 160 countries to ensure future global access.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;GARDP is committed to bringing new classes of antibiotics to market to tackle the rise and spread of <mark>AMR</mark>,&rdquo; said Dr Manica Balasegaram, Executive Director of GARDP. &ldquo;This new partnership demonstrates the flexibility of GARDP&rsquo;s public-private partnership model. It is great to see a Swiss for-profit and a Swiss non-profit working together to develop an innovative new solution to address gonorrhea and explore opportunities in other areas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The novel drug candidate Debio1453 offers significant hope, demonstrating strong activity against <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> strains by targeting the essential FabI enzyme for <mark>bacteria</mark>l survival, with the added crucial advantage of showing no cross-resistance to currently available antibiotic classes.</p>\n<p>Untreated gonorrhea can have a devastating impact on both men and women&rsquo;s health, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. It can also impact partners and increase HIV transmission risk. Babies born while a mother is infected with gonorrhea are at risk of severe eye <mark>infection</mark>s that can result in blindness.</p>\n<p>The high financial and social costs of these effects are compounded by rapidly spreading <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> in <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, which prolongs <mark>infection</mark>s and increases the long-term health burden globally. Because resistance spreads quickly and surveillance is often lacking, especially in resource-limited settings, the actual level of treatment failure is likely far higher than current reports indicate. This trend threatens health systems worldwide, including those in high-income countries.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Debiopharm&rsquo;s commitment to patients</b></p>\n<p>Debiopharm aims to develop innovative therapies that target high unmet medical needs primarily in oncology and <mark>bacteria</mark>l <mark>infection</mark>s.

Although clinicians have recognised that these chronic wound <mark>infection</mark>s are often complex, little is known about the specific <mark>pathogens</mark> involved, particularly E. coli, despite its frequent detection in clinical samples.</p>\n<p>Researchers analysed whole-genome sequences from 42 E. coli strains isolated from infected diabetic foot ulcers in patients across Nigeria, the UK, Ghana, Sweden, Malaysia, China, South Korea, Brazil, India and the USA. By sequencing the complete DNA of each <mark>bacteria</mark>l strain, the team was able to examine global patterns in the biology of E. coli associated with diabetic foot disease. This approach enabled the researchers to compare genetic differences between strains, identify genes linked to <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, and pinpoint factors that contribute to disease severity.</p>\n<p>The genomic analysis showed that the E. coli strains were highly diverse. The <mark>bacteria</mark> belonged to many different genetic groups and carried a wide range of genes linked to <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> and disease. This demonstrates that there is no single type of E. coli responsible for diabetic foot <mark>infection</mark>s, and distinct lineages were independently capable of adapting to the diabetic foot environment.</p>\n<p>By analysing how the strains are related and identifying the resistance mechanisms and virulence traits (the features or tools that make a microbe more harmful) they carry, the research helps explain why some diabetic foot <mark>infection</mark>s are particularly difficult to treat or can progress rapidly to severe illness.</p>\n<p>Notably, around 8 per cent of the strains were classified as <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> or extensively <mark>drug-resistant</mark>, meaning they are resistant to multiple or nearly all available antibiotics.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Understanding these <mark>bacteria</mark> at a genomic level is a crucial step towards improving diagnosis and enabling more targeted treatments for people with diabetes.

The findings could help to explain why some <mark>infection</mark>s become particularly difficult to treat and why they can lead to severe, sometimes life-threatening, outcomes.</p>\n<p>Diabetic foot <mark>infection</mark>s remain one of the most serious complications of diabetes and are a leading cause of lower-limb amputation worldwide. Although clinicians have recognised that these chronic wound <mark>infection</mark>s are often complex, little is known about the specific <mark>pathogens</mark> involved, particularly E. coli, despite its frequent detection in clinical samples.</p>\n<p>Researchers analysed whole-genome sequences from 42 E. coli strains isolated from infected diabetic foot ulcers in patients across Nigeria, the UK, Ghana, Sweden, Malaysia, China, South Korea, Brazil, India and the USA. By sequencing the complete DNA of each <mark>bacteria</mark>l strain, the team was able to examine global patterns in the biology of E. coli associated with diabetic foot disease. This approach enabled the researchers to compare genetic differences between strains, identify genes linked to <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, and pinpoint factors that contribute to disease severity.</p>\n<p>The genomic analysis showed that the E. coli strains were highly diverse. The <mark>bacteria</mark> belonged to many different genetic groups and carried a wide range of genes linked to <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark> and disease. This demonstrates that there is no single type of E. coli responsible for diabetic foot <mark>infection</mark>s, and distinct lineages were independently capable of adapting to the diabetic foot environment.</p>\n<p>By analysing how the strains are related and identifying the resistance mechanisms and virulence traits (the features or tools that make a microbe more harmful) they carry, the research helps explain why some diabetic foot <mark>infection</mark>s are particularly difficult to treat or can progress rapidly to severe illness.</p>\n<p>Notably, around 8 per cent of the strains were classified as <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> or extensively <mark>drug-resistant</mark>, meaning they are resistant to multiple or nearly all available antibiotics.</p>\n<p>Dr Vincenzo Torraca, Lecturer in Infectious Disease at King's College London and senior author of the paper, said: &quot;Understanding these <mark>bacteria</mark> at a genomic level is a crucial step towards improving diagnosis and enabling more targeted treatments for people with diabetes. By identifying which E. coli strains are most common and which antibiotics they are likely to resist, clinicians can choose therapies that are more likely to work, helping to reduce prolonged <mark>infection</mark>, hospitalisation, and the risk of amputation.&quot;</p>\n<p>Victor Ajumobi, a second-year PhD student at King's College London and the University of Westminster, and first author of the paper, added: &quot;This information will be particularly valuable in low-resource settings, where E. coli <mark>infection</mark>s of diabetic foot ulcers are more common and where rapid diagnostic tools for <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> are not always readily available.&quot;</p>\n<p>Future research will focus on understanding how specific virulence factors identified in the study contribute to disease progression. Many of the isolates carry genes that enable E. coli to attach to host tissues or evade the immune system. Investigating how these traits operate within the diabetic foot environment could reveal new therapeutic targets and support the development of improved treatment strategies.</p>\n<p>Read the full paper: <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02837-25\">https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02837-25</a></p>\n<p>/Public Release.

He described the BSL-4 facility as a &ldquo;protective shield&rdquo; for the country&rsquo;s health security and said it would usher in a new era of bio-safety and self-reliance.</p>\n<p>The facility, being built at a cost of ₹362 crore over an area of 11,000 square metres, will be India&rsquo;s second BSL-4 laboratory after the National Institute of Virology in Pune, and the first such high-level lab to be established by a state government. Once operational, it will enable Indian scientists to conduct research on highly infectious and deadly viruses in a secure environment and significantly reduce the country&rsquo;s dependence on foreign laboratories for testing dangerous <mark>pathogens</mark>.</p>\n<p>Shah noted that the laboratory will house world-class infrastructure to study zoonotic diseases &ndash; those that spread from animals to humans &ndash; which account for an estimated 60-70 per cent of infectious diseases. He said the facility aligns with India&rsquo;s One Health Mission, aimed at safeguarding the health of humans, animals and the environment.</p>\n<p>Highlighting the rapid growth of India&rsquo;s biotechnology sector, the Home Minister said the country&rsquo;s bio-economy has expanded from USD 10 billion in 2014 to USD 166 billion by 2024. The number of biotechnology startups has risen from fewer than 500 in 2014 to over 10,000 by 2025, while patent filings have increased more than tenfold. &ldquo;Our youth have proven they are not just job seekers, but job creators,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Shah also underscored India&rsquo;s leadership in vaccine manufacturing, noting that the country produces nearly 60 per cent of the world&rsquo;s vaccines. He cited the development of the indigenous cervical cancer vaccine Cervavac and the world&rsquo;s first DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine as examples of India&rsquo;s growing scientific capabilities.</p>\n<p>Referring to global health challenges, the Home Minister warned that <mark>Antimicrobial Resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>) poses a &ldquo;silent disaster&rdquo; for humanity. He stressed the need for a clear roadmap, timely treatment and widespread public awareness to prevent <mark>infection</mark>s and preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations.</p>\n<p>Linking science with cultural heritage, Shah said development and tradition are not contradictory. He pointed to the recent inauguration of the &lsquo;Somnath Swabhimaan Parv&rsquo; by the Prime Minister at the Somnath Temple, calling the ancient shrine a symbol of India&rsquo;s resilience and pride. &ldquo;The laying of the BSL-4 lab foundation stone a day after the Somnath Swabhimaan celebrations shows that science and heritage can progress together,&rdquo; he said.</p>",

On this occasion, the Minister for Science and Technology, Arjun Modhwadia, was also present.<p>During this ceremony, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, granted a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the Gujarat Science and Technology Department to designate the &quot;Bio Safety Level-4&quot; facility of the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) as the 'National Centre for High Containment Pathogen Research Facility' under the Government of India's &quot;BioE3 Policy&quot;.</p><p>The Union Home Minister stated that a new era has begun in Gujarat for the development of India's health security and biosafety sector. After Pune, this is only the second such high-level lab in the country; however, due to the state government's special initiative, it will become the country's first state government-operated BSL-4 lab, to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 362 crore. In the future, this lab will prove to be India's impregnable security shield and a strong fortress of bio-facilities to combat deadly viruses.</p><p>Reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision that 'science and technology should be the foundation pillar of national development', he said, &quot;This international-standard lab will open many avenues of opportunity for researchers and youth. Especially, this lab will accelerate the &quot;One Health Mission&quot; initiated by the Prime Minister to prevent diseases transmitted from animals to humans.&quot; In the face of recent challenges such as Chandipura and Lumpy Skin Disease in Gujarat, a research-based, permanent security arrangement was essential.&quot;</p><p>Presenting figures reflecting the revolutionary transformation in India's biotechnology sector, he said, &quot;unprecedented progress has been made in the last 11 years&quot;. India's bio-economy, which stood at 10 billion dollars in 2014, has grown to over 166 billion dollars by 2024. Given that research is the 'soul of innovation', and thanks to the infrastructure provided by the central government, Indian scientists today are conducting world-class research in a highly secure environment.</p><p>Highlighting growth in the startup and investment sectors, he noted that in 2014, there were fewer than 500 startups in this field; today, there are more than 10,000. Similarly, the number of incubators has increased from 6 to 95, and incubation space has expanded from 60,000 square feet to 9 lakh square feet. Notably, private investment funding has increased from Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 7,000 crore, and the number of patent filings has risen from 125 to over 1,300, indicating that India's youth are now becoming 'job givers' rather than 'job seekers'.</p><p>He stated that under the Government of India's &quot;BioE3 Policy&quot;, there is a resolve to take the country to greater heights in the biotechnology sector. India today is indigenously manufacturing vaccines for serious diseases such as COVID-19 and cervical cancer. He called upon students and researchers, stating that the responsibility of ensuring India's health security now rests on their shoulders. This lab will enable many positive transformations in the health sector in the coming years.</p><p>He stated that under the Prime Minister's leadership, India is moving forward by integrating 'development' and 'heritage'. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian scientists developed vaccines quickly, safeguarding 140 crore citizens and helping the world, based on the approach of making science and technology a foundational pillar of national development.</p><p>With this lab, Indian scientists will no longer need to rely on foreign countries for sample testing, thereby fulfilling the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' objective in the health sector. He expressed confidence that by 2027, India will also be among the world's leading nations in the semiconductor and biotechnology sectors.</p><p>He expressed concern about the 'silent disaster' of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>) driven by antibiotic misuse and urged students and researchers to protect the next generation through research. He called upon students studying in the biotech sector to make the most of national facilities to develop pharmaceutical formulations and vaccines that benefit human life and help achieve the goal of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047. This facility will emerge as a protective shield not only for Gujarat but for the entire country.</p><p>As the country moves towards 'Viksit Bharat' under the guidance of the Prime Minister, science, such as biotechnology, will provide us with security, while heritage, such as the Somnath Swabhiman Parva, will give us a proud identity. India today is building the edifice of modern science on the foundation of culture. This new biotech research will take the country's healthcare system to new heights.</p><p>Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel described this project, which will enhance the country's preparedness against potential pandemics, as an important initiative within Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for healthcare and modern infrastructure development.</p><p>He said, &quot;The Prime Minister is a visionary leader who thinks ahead of time, and it is due to such vision that by operationalising the GBRC, the goal of self-reliance has been achieved so that diagnosis and research of serious health sector challenges such as viral outbreaks, genetic <mark>infection</mark>s, and pandemics need not depend on external institutions&quot;.</p><p>The Chief Minister expressed confidence that, with the operationalisation of the BSL-4 lab, research on high-risk viruses will be possible within the state, enabling timely, accurate, and reliable diagnosis and further strengthening and equipping the healthcare system.</p><p>He stated that GBRC is not only a research institution but also a nodal centre of the state's biotech capacity, adding that research conducted at the BSL-4 lab will directly translate into diagnostics, treatments, and public health policies through translational research. He stated that this BSL-4 facility will prove to be a milestone in realising the Prime Minister's resolve of Viksit Bharat @ 2047 through a healthy, secure, and self-reliant India.</p><p>While delivering the welcome address, Science and Technology Minister Arjun Modhwadia stated that, just as Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel transformed India's history and geography, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have worked to shape the destiny of modern India and Gujarat.</p><p>Stating that Gujarat's first and the country's most important research facility will prove decisive in addressing global health challenges, the Minister said 'Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission' (GSBTM) was established based on the vision of the then Chief Minister and present Prime Minister.</p><p>As a result of that vision, Gujarat is now the first state in Asia to have a dedicated biotech university. The research facility whose foundation stone was laid today is Gujarat's first such research facility designated by the Government of India.&quot;</p><p>This event was attended by Gandhinagar Mayor Miraben Patel, Members of Parliament: Hasmukh Patel, Hari Patel, Mayank Nayak; Members of the Legislative Assembly: Ritaben Patel and Alpesh Thakor, Secretary of Biotechnology, Government of India; Rajesh Gokhale, Secretary of the Science and Technology Department; P Bharati, Gandhinagar District Collector; Mehul Dave, along with various dignitaries, state government officials and staff, and citizens.

If the flu lasts for two weeks, that does not necessarily mean you have the super flu.)</p>\n<p>The only way to determine if a person has the &ldquo;super flu&rdquo; is through a test conducted in the hospital, Solante said, adding that the doctor has the discretion to decide who should be tested.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We usually do it, testing them, especially for those who are [part of the] vulnerable population. <em>Ibig sabihin, itong may mga edad na, may mga </em>(This means the elderly and those with) comorbidities,&rdquo; Solante said. &ldquo;So, meaning if you will be able to detect the presence of influenza in that particular patient, there is treatment that is highly effective to prevent complications.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since &ldquo;super flu&rdquo; and a regular flu have the same symptoms, Solante said the treatment is also similar.</p>\n<p>A person battling the flu may take an anti-viral drug as it is effective for both seasonal and &ldquo;super flu.&rdquo; Solante reminded the public to not take antibiotics to treat flu symptoms.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You will be in danger of promoting <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>To relieve the disease, the infectious disease expert also advised taking a rest and drinking lots of fluids.</p>\n<p>In cases when symptoms are accompanied by difficulty in breathing, Solante said the person should consult a doctor for proper diagnosis.</p>\n<h5><strong>Avoiding the flu</strong></h5>\n<p>The DOH and Solante said vaccination would help in avoiding the flu, regardless if it is regular or the &ldquo;super flu.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Vaccination is still expected to protect against severe illness and prevent hospitalization,&rdquo; the DOH said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even if it is mutated subclade K, the data is still telling us that the flu vaccine that we are using are still effective,&rdquo; said Solante.</p>\n<p>The doctor also encouraged people, especially high-risk individuals, to wear face masks particularly in crowded places as it is &ldquo;one of the most important barriers&rdquo; against the <mark>infection</mark>.</p>\n<p>Washing hands is also advised because &ldquo;​​surfaces can also be the source of contamination.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Solante said the most important prevention is enhancing the immune system.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You need to rest. You need to have&hellip;proper food, diet, and then less stressful environment or event,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Health Secretary Ted Herbosa earlier said the &ldquo;super flu&rdquo; in the Philippines is not alarming.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the warning I will give is for Filipinos that will travel to the temperate countries, that will go to North America, to the UK. If you&rsquo;re going there, be knowledgeable that there is a spread of super flu in that area. Maybe get the northern hemisphere vaccine, that&rsquo;s my best advice for them,&rdquo; Herbosa said in a briefing. <strong>&ndash; Rappler.com</strong></p>",

        "full_content_html": "<p>The GARDP Foundation (known as GARDP) and the privately-owned, global biopharmaceutical company Debiopharm today announced that they have entered into a collaboration and license agreement to pursue the development of Debio1453, a novel, first-in-class antibiotic targeting <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>. With 82 million new cases each year, and the continued spread of <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> strains, gonorrhea represents a global health crisis. This new partnership will help ensure that gonorrhea continues to be a treatable disease and will alleviate the risk of the emergence of future resistance, by ensuring that the antibiotic pipeline continues to be replenished.</p>\n<p>Gonorrhea caused by <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> is currently in danger of becoming untreatable because of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>). Having developed resistance to almost all antibiotics used to treat it, only one last recommended treatment, ceftriaxone, remains effective, and now we are seeing a growing number of cases that are resistant to this. Even with the recent approval in late 2025 of two new first-in-class treatments for <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, there is growing concern that without ongoing development of innovative new treatments, like Debio1453, the rapid emergence of resistance will see this &quot;super gonorrhea&quot; outpace antibiotic development.</p>\n<p>&quot;As a private company aligning our efforts with a not-for-profit organization, we see this collaboration with GARDP as a pioneering public-private model to expand global access to this innovative new drug candidate. The confirmation of this partnership is a powerful indicator of Debio1453's potential to replenish a critically depleted anti<mark>bacteria</mark>l pipeline, addressing a severe therapeutic gap,&quot; said Morgane Vanbiervliet, Director, Global Development and Licensing, Debiopharm. &quot;For those struggling with <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> gonorrhea, this agreement signals a decisive step toward restoring effective treatment options and ensuring long-term antibiotic sustainability.&quot;</p>\n<p>With crucial funding from the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant <mark>Bacteria</mark> Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X), the development of Debio1453 successfully progressed from a preclinical candidate to a clinical stage asset. As part of this new collaboration and license agreement, Debiopharm remains in charge of the completion of the Debio1453 Phase I clinical trial, while GARDP will lead other non-clinical and clinical development activities, as well as chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) activities. Both organizations aim to ensure that the global development and future access strategies of Debio1453 are aligned with country-specific regulatory requirements, health system realities and local economic constraints. Debiopharm has granted GARDP manufacturing and commercialization rights in relation to Debio1453 across more than 160 countries to ensure future global access.</p>\n<p>&quot;GARDP is committed to bringing new classes of antibiotics to market to tackle the rise and spread of <mark>AMR</mark>,&quot; said Dr Manica Balasegaram, Executive Director of GARDP. &quot;This new partnership demonstrates the flexibility of GARDP's public-private partnership model. It is great to see a Swiss for-profit and a Swiss non-profit working together to develop an innovative new solution to address gonorrhea and explore opportunities in other areas.&quot;</p>\n<p>The novel drug candidate Debio1453 offers significant hope, demonstrating strong activity against <mark>multi<mark>drug-resistant</mark></mark> strains by targeting the essential FabI enzyme for <mark>bacteria</mark>l survival, with the added crucial advantage of showing no cross-resistance to currently available antibiotic classes.</p>\n<p>Untreated gonorrhea can have a devastating impact on both men and women's health, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. It can also impact partners and increase HIV transmission risk. Babies born while a mother is infected with gonorrhea are at risk of severe eye <mark>infection</mark>s that can result in blindness.</p>\n<p>The high financial and social costs of these effects are compounded by rapidly spreading <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> in <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, which prolongs <mark>infection</mark>s and increases the long-term health burden globally. Because resistance spreads quickly and surveillance is often lacking, especially in resource-limited settings, the actual level of treatment failure is likely far higher than current reports indicate. This trend threatens health systems worldwide, including those in high-income countries.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><b>Debiopharm's commitment to patients</b></p>\n<p>Debiopharm aims to develop innovative therapies that target high unmet medical needs primarily in oncology and <mark>bacteria</mark>l <mark>infection</mark>s.
