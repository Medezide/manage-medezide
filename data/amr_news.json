The study is significant since for many tribal families across the forests and foothills of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, access to safe drinking water remains uncertain.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>A study of gut microbiomes from some of India&rsquo;s most isolated tribal communities has found that <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> (<mark>AMR</mark>) and <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark> genes (ARGs) are widely present even in populations with little or no exposure to antibiotics, challenging the assumption that resistance is driven primarily by clinical drug use.</p>\n<p>The findings suggest that everyday consumption of unprotected drinking water may be a key route through which resistant microbes and genes enter and persist in the human gut, highlighting the environment &mdash; rather than medicine alone &mdash; as a critical front in India&rsquo;s growing <mark>AMR</mark> challenge.</p>\n<p>For many tribal families across the forests and foothills of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, access to safe drinking water remains uncertain, often purchased in cans, fetched from distant hand pumps, or drawn from sources about which they know little.</p>\n<p>To understand how these daily realities shape health in these communities, <strong>South First</strong> spoke to members of two Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) &mdash; the Irulas and the Kuruwas &mdash; who shared the concerns they live with but are rarely asked about.</p>\n<h3><strong>What the study said</strong></h3>\n<p>The 2025 study titled &ldquo;<mark>Antimicrobial resistance</mark>: A one health metagenomic study of Indian tribal gut&rdquo;, led by SA Mollick and team, focused on 103 healthy adults from three Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups &mdash; Irula, Jenu Kuruba, and Kurumba &mdash; across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala.</p>\n<p>Researchers combined stool sample metagenomic sequencing with socio-demographic data, including participants&rsquo; primary water source and residential context, to understand how environmental and lifestyle factors shape antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) in the gut.</p>\n<p>By sequencing the entire microbial DNA from each sample, the team was able to identify and quantify resistance genes, providing a detailed picture of how local environments influence gut resistomes even in communities with minimal antibiotic use.</p>\n<p>One of the most striking findings was that the type of drinking water &mdash; stream or tubewell &mdash; strongly influenced the variety and nature of antimicrobial-resistance genes. Those relying on stream water carried a broader diversity of resistance determinants, particularly genes linked to metals, biocides, and multi-compound resistance.</p>\n<p>In contrast, tubewell users showed higher levels of antibiotic-specific resistance genes. The researchers also observed that metal-resistance genes were significantly enriched in people consuming stream water, suggesting that exposure to heavy metals and other environmental factors can unintentionally select for <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, a process called co-selection.</p>\n<p>Analysis using Principal Coordinates Analysis further confirmed a clear separation between the gut resistomes of stream-water and tubewell-water consumers, demonstrating how closely resistance patterns are tied to the environment and daily exposure.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the study acknowledged important limitations. It did not directly examine water, soil, food, or livestock for resistance genes, and it measured only the presence of ARGs rather than their activity or potential for transfer between <mark>bacteria</mark>.</p>\n<p>Even with minimal antibiotic use, environmental exposures alone can shape gut resistomes in isolated communities. The study highlights the need for safe water, monitoring, and integrated One-Health strategies.</p>\n<h3><strong>Illness and fragile healthcare </strong></h3>\n<p>Radha, an Irula resident of Puliyur in Thirukalukundram in the Chengalpattu district of Tamil Nadu, said her family has long relied on buying water cans because the local supply line has remained out of service.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We get drinking water from the church,&rdquo; she said, explaining that each 20-litre costs ₹30. Despite repeatedly approaching the village head and the local MLA, she said, &ldquo;No one has done anything&rdquo; to restore the government-provided water.</p>\n<p>When deliveries are delayed, her children end up drinking whatever is available nearby. Radha said the water often contains insects and debris, and illnesses routinely follow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I get a fever,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My children get many diseases; we can&rsquo;t say we won&rsquo;t get sick, because we definitely do.&rdquo; Treatment depends on what is accessible that day &mdash; sometimes a government hospital, sometimes a nearby medical shop.</p>\n<h3><strong>How water shapes daily life in the settlement </strong></h3>\n<p>Radha&rsquo;s story is not an outlier. Across Irula and Kuruwa settlements in the region, families describe a cycle of poor water access, recurring illness, and fragile healthcare support that leaves them constantly vulnerable &mdash; long before any laboratory detects the rise of <mark>antimicrobial resistance</mark>.</p>\n<p>In Kothimangalam, Vasantha, a member of the Irula community, said that the families there rely on water drawn from a nearby lake-fed well, despite its far-from-ideal conditions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is always a little salt in the water,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And sand too &mdash; we can see it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is the only source available, so everyone drinks from the well,&rdquo; she explained.</p>\n<p>When asked about illnesses, she insisted they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get many diseases,&rdquo; but quickly added that if anyone fell sick, they have no choice but to travel out.</p>\n<p>Travelling for care is a struggle: &ldquo;I have to take a bus or an auto to go to Nandambakkam,&rdquo; she said &mdash; the closest point where treatment is accessible.</p>\n<p>Beside her stood Ravi, from the Kuruwa community, who cut in and explained the broader issue: Their settlement still has no motorable road. &ldquo;The road is closed&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n<p>Residents said they have repeatedly raised the issue with local elected representatives, including during election visits, but the situation has not improved.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They came asking for votes,&rdquo; Ravi said, &ldquo;but nothing has changed.&rdquo; The well water, he added, is entirely dependent on groundwater and rain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it rains, there will be water,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If there is no rain, the water level gets worse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Taken together, the lived experiences of Radha, Vasantha, and Ravi underscore a simple but urgent reality: For many tribal communities, water is not just scarce or inconvenient &mdash; it is unpredictable, untreated, and often the first point of exposure to invisible risks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Environmental and <mark>bacteria</mark>l drivers of resistance </strong></h3>\n<p>Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, a gastroenterologist and a functionary of the Indian Medical Association, highlighted that <mark>AMR</mark> has multiple causes beyond antibiotic misuse.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Untreated water can contain <mark>bacteria</mark> already resistant to antibiotics, either from prior human use or indirectly through contaminated food such as vegetables, fruits, or meat,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>Agricultural practices also contribute: Manure and runoff can carry antibiotic-resistant <mark>bacteria</mark>, while careless disposal of medical waste exposes environmental <mark>bacteria</mark> to drugs, gradually fostering resistance.</p>\n<p>He further explained how resistance spreads among <mark>bacteria</mark> themselves. &ldquo;Once <mark>bacteria</mark> develop resistance, they can transfer that ability to other <mark>bacteria</mark> nearby through horizontal gene transfer, using plasmids or other genetic material,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Environmental exposures also play a role: <mark>Bacteria</mark> develop pumps to expel toxic substances such as heavy metals, and resistance genes for metals and antibiotics often coexist. This means exposure to metals in polluted water can unintentionally select for <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, a process called co-selection.</p>\n<h3><strong>Human factors and public health solutions </strong></h3>\n<p>Overuse of antibiotics remains the main driver of <mark>AMR</mark>. Patients with repeated hospitalisations or multiple rounds of antibiotics tend to have more resistant <mark>infection</mark>s.</p>\n<p>In India, over-the-counter antibiotic sales and self-medication exacerbate the problem, though measures like Kerala&rsquo;s restriction on selling antibiotics without a prescription have proven helpful.</p>\n<p>Dr Jayadevan stressed that public health measures beyond rational antibiotic use are equally critical. &ldquo;Providing safe and clean drinking water reduces waterborne diseases and limits exposure to resistant <mark>bacteria</mark>. Unless we address all contributing factors, from unsafe water to misuse of antibiotics, we cannot effectively control <mark>AMR</mark>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>(Edited by Muhammed Fazil.)</em></p>",

That was the reality for Roman soldiers stationed at Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall, according to a groundbreaking new study. Researchers have unearthed evidence of at least three intestinal parasites in ancient latrine soil, revealing a surprisingly widespread <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> issue that echoes into modern concerns about sanitation, <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, and the spread of disease.</p>\n<h2>Unearthing the Past: Parasites at Vindolanda</h2>\n<p>The study, published in <i>Parasitology</i>, focused on the auxiliary fort of Vindolanda, a remarkably well-preserved Roman site in northern England. The site&rsquo;s unique, oxygen-free mud layers have allowed for the preservation of incredibly delicate artifacts &ndash; from writing tablets to shoes &ndash; and now, microscopic evidence of ancient ailments. Researchers meticulously analyzed soil samples from the fort&rsquo;s third-century latrines, sifting for parasite eggs. Their findings? Evidence of roundworms (intestinal worms), whipworms, and, crucially, <i>Giardia duodenalis</i>.</p>\n<h3>The Trio of Troubles: What These Parasites Do</h3>\n<p>Roundworms and whipworms are familiar foes, causing common gastrointestinal distress like stomach pain, fever, and diarrhea. However, the discovery of <i>Giardia</i> is particularly significant. This parasite causes giardiasis, an <mark>infection</mark> that can lead to chronic <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> problems extending far beyond digestive issues &ndash; including irritable bowel syndrome, eye damage, arthritis, and even neurological effects. As study co-author Piers Mitchell of the University of Cambridge explains, <i>Giardia</i> is &ldquo;the most likely to cause serious <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> problems&rdquo; of the three identified.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the Wall: Implications for Roman Health and Beyond</h2>\n<p>While evidence of roundworms and whipworms has been found in Roman Britain before, this is the first concrete proof of <i>Giardia</i>&rsquo;s presence. This raises questions about whether the parasite was already endemic to the British Isles before the Roman invasion. More importantly, it highlights the pervasive nature of parasitic <mark>infection</mark> throughout the Roman Empire, even with relatively advanced sanitation systems. Estimates suggest that between 10 and 40% of people in Roman times were infected with intestinal worms, a figure that underscores the challenges of maintaining public <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> even with infrastructure like sewers.</p>\n<h3>A Vulnerable Population: Children and the Risks of Diarrhea</h3>\n<p>The presence of these parasites wasn&rsquo;t just a discomfort for adult soldiers. Archaeological evidence suggests families lived at Vindolanda, and children were particularly vulnerable. Diarrhea, a common symptom of these <mark>infection</mark>s, can be fatal for young children due to dehydration. Chronic parasitic <mark>infection</mark>s can also stunt growth and impair cognitive development. This paints a sobering picture of daily life on the Roman frontier, where even basic <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> was a constant struggle.</p>\n<h2>From Ancient Rome to Modern Challenges: A Looming Threat?</h2>\n<p>The lessons from Vindolanda extend far beyond historical curiosity. We live in an era of increasing <mark>antibiotic resistance</mark>, making parasitic <mark>infection</mark>s harder to treat. Climate change is also expanding the geographic range of many parasites, potentially exposing new populations. Furthermore, aging infrastructure in many parts of the <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/world/\">world</a> &ndash; including developed nations &ndash; can lead to water contamination and increased risk of parasitic spread. The Roman experience serves as a stark reminder that even sophisticated societies are vulnerable to the insidious threat of parasitic <mark>infection</mark>s.</p>\n<h3>The Rise of Neglected Tropical Diseases</h3>\n<p>The challenges faced by Roman soldiers mirror those confronting communities grappling with <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/neglected-tropical-diseases\">Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)</a> today. These diseases, often caused by parasites, disproportionately affect impoverished populations in tropical and subtropical regions. Investing in sanitation, clean water access, and research into new treatments is crucial to preventing a resurgence of these ancient ailments. The study of ancient parasite prevalence, like that at Vindolanda, provides valuable baseline data for understanding the long-term impact of these diseases and tracking the effectiveness of intervention strategies.</p>\n<p>The discovery at Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall isn&rsquo;t just about understanding the past; it&rsquo;s a critical warning for the future. By learning from the <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> challenges faced by Roman soldiers, we can better prepare for and mitigate the growing threat of parasitic <mark>infection</mark>s in a <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/world/\">world</a> facing new environmental and public <a data-ail=\"8482494\" href=\"https://www.archyde.com/category/health/\">health</a> pressures.

The flurry of activity, from Pete Alonso&rsquo;s move to the Orioles to Dylan Cease joining the Blue Jays, isn&rsquo;t simply filling roster holes; it&rsquo;s a strategic overhaul with long-term implications.</p>\n<h2>The Orioles&rsquo; Ascent: A Blueprint for Contenders</h2>\n<p>The <b>MLB offseason</b> has been dominated by the Orioles&rsquo; aggressive pursuit of talent. Landing Pete Alonso with a five-year, $155 million contract is a statement. It&rsquo;s a clear signal they&rsquo;re not content with a single playoff appearance; they&rsquo;re building for sustained success. This isn&rsquo;t an isolated incident. Adding Ryan Helsley and trading for Taylor Ward further solidifies their position as a legitimate contender in the American League East. Their strategy &ndash; combining shrewd free agent signings with targeted trades &ndash; offers a compelling blueprint for other teams seeking to close the gap with established powerhouses.</p>\n<h3>Beyond Baltimore: Emerging Spenders and Shifting Priorities</h3>\n<p>The Orioles aren&rsquo;t alone. The Giants&rsquo; aggressive moves, securing Adrian Houser, Jason Foley, and Luke Weaver, demonstrate a willingness to invest in pitching depth. The Mets, despite recent struggles, have been active, bringing in Marcus Semien and Devin Williams, signaling a commitment to rebuilding through high-impact acquisitions. Even teams like the Braves, already a perennial contender, are bolstering their roster with additions like Robert Suarez and Mike Yastrzemski. This widespread investment suggests a league-wide recognition that standing still is falling behind.</p>\n<h2>The Pitching Premium: A Response to Offensive Evolution?</h2>\n<p>A notable trend throughout the <b>free agency</b> period has been the premium placed on pitching. Multiple pitchers &ndash; Dylan Cease, Sonny Gray, Edwin Diaz &ndash; have secured lucrative contracts, and teams are aggressively pursuing arms through trades. This isn&rsquo;t accidental. With offensive strategies evolving and power numbers continuing to rise, the need for reliable, high-quality pitching is more critical than ever. The emphasis on strike-throwing and limiting hard contact is driving up the value of pitchers who can consistently deliver in high-leverage situations. This trend is likely to continue in future offseasons, potentially leading to even more significant investments in pitching development and analytics.</p>\n<h3>The Rise of Reliever Value and Bullpen Construction</h3>\n<p>Beyond starting pitchers, the market for elite relievers has also heated up. The contracts handed out to players like Robert Suarez and the continued interest in proven closers demonstrate a growing understanding of the importance of a dominant bullpen. Teams are increasingly recognizing that a strong bullpen can be the difference between a regular season win and a playoff series victory. This shift in valuation is influencing bullpen construction strategies, with teams prioritizing high-leverage arms and specialized roles.</p>\n<h2>Trade Dynamics: A New Era of Asset Management</h2>\n<p>The <b>MLB trades</b> this offseason haven&rsquo;t been limited to simply moving players; they&rsquo;ve been about strategically reallocating assets. The Angels&rsquo; trade of Taylor Ward to the Orioles for Grayson Rodriguez is a prime example. The Angels are shedding salary and acquiring a promising young pitcher, while the Orioles are adding a proven offensive threat. This type of trade &ndash; focused on long-term value and organizational fit &ndash; is becoming increasingly common. Teams are becoming more sophisticated in their asset management, recognizing the importance of building a sustainable pipeline of talent.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers, consistently a model franchise, have also been active on the trade market, making smaller moves to address specific needs and maintain roster flexibility. Their willingness to trade prospects for established players demonstrates a commitment to winning now, while also preserving their long-term competitiveness. This balancing act is a key characteristic of successful organizations.</p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead: The 2026 Landscape and Beyond</h2>\n<p>The spending and strategic moves of this <b>baseball offseason</b> are laying the groundwork for the 2026 season and beyond. The Orioles&rsquo; emergence as a contender, the emphasis on pitching, and the evolving trade dynamics all point towards a more competitive and unpredictable MLB landscape. Teams that prioritize pitching development, embrace data-driven decision-making, and are willing to invest in both free agency and trades will be best positioned for success. The days of a few dominant teams consistently controlling the postseason are numbered. A new era of competitive balance is dawning, and the next few years will be fascinating to watch unfold.</p>\n<p>What impact will these offseason moves have on the playoff picture?
